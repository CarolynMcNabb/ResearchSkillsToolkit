# Welcome! A General Coding Guide that's made for **YOU**!

If you've ever opened a code file and thought:  
> “This looks like a different language…"
> 
> "I’m not sure I can do this.”
> 
> "How do I use this?"

You’re not alone. Many researchers (biologists, psychologists, economists) learn coding on the go without any formal training. That means you’re learning the hard way, often under pressure. **This guide is here to make that easier.**

❌ **You do NOT need to be an expert** ❌

❌ **You do NOT need prior experience** ❌

✅ **You just need to start small** ✅

##  What You'll Learn  
This resource will show you **simple principles** that apply to any programming language (Python, R, MATLAB, JavaScript, etc.) to make your code:  

- **Readable** → So future you knows what you meant (even when you come back after a few weeks, months, or even years!)  
- **Organised** → So your projects don’t feel like chaos (Just like your bedroom — let’s know where everything is!)  
- **Reusable** → So you never have to rewrite the same thing twice (You can share it with others so they can try your code too without getting lost!)  

 **Think of it as a lab notebook for your code.**  
The goal is to help you write **good code**, not turn you into a software engineer.
