First, we examined all nonsignificant findings mentioned in the abstracts of the 2015 volumes of Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, and Psychological Science (N = 137). In 72\% of these cases, nonsignificant results were misinterpreted, in that the authors inferred that the effect was absent.

  abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of three water immersion interventions performed after active recovery compared to active recovery only on the resolution of inflammation and markers of muscle damage post-exercise. Methods Nine physically active men (n = 9; age 20-35~years) performed an intensive loading protocol, including maximal jumps and sprinting on four occasions. After each trial, one of three recovery interventions (10~min duration) was used in a random order: cold-water immersion (CWI, 10 {$^\circ$}C), thermoneutral water immersion (TWI, 24 {$^\circ$}C), contrast water therapy (CWT, alternately 10 {$^\circ$}C and 38 {$^\circ$}C). All of these methods were performed after an active recovery (10~min bicycle ergometer), and were compared to active recovery only (ACT). 5~min, 1, 24, 48, and 96~h after exercise bouts, immune response and recovery were assessed through leukocyte subsets, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, myoglobin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations. Results Significant changes in all blood markers occurred at post-loading (p\,{$<$}\,0.05), but there were no significant differences observed in the recovery between methods. However, retrospective analysis revealed significant trial-order effects for myoglobin and neutrophils (p {$<$} 0.01). Only lymphocytes displayed satisfactory reliability in the exercise response, with intraclass correlation coefficient {$>$} 0.5. Conclusions The recovery methods did not affect the resolution of inflammatory and immune responses after high-intensity sprinting and jumping exercise. It is notable that the biomarker responses were variable within individuals. Thus, the lack of differences between recovery methods may have been influenced by the reliability of exercise-induced biomarker responses.

  abstract = {When designing a study, the planned sample size is often based on power analyses. One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index ({$\eta^2$}, {$\omega^2$} and {$\varepsilon^2$}) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of {$\eta^2$} in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies. Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue. We urge researchers to consider alternative approaches to determining the sample size of their studies, and discuss several options. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The movement towards open science is a consequence of seemingly pervasive failures to replicate previous research. This transition comes with great benefits but also significant challenges that are likely to affect those who carry out the research, usually early career researchers (ECRs). Here, we describe key benefits, including reputational gains, increased chances of publication, and a broader increase in the reliability of research. The increased chances of publication are supported by exploratory analyses indicating null findings are substantially more likely to be published via open registered reports in comparison to more conventional methods. These benefits are balanced by challenges that we have encountered and that involve increased costs in terms of flexibility, time, and issues with the current incentive structure, all of which seem to affect ECRs acutely. Although there are major obstacles to the early adoption of open science, overall open science practices should benefit both the ECR and improve the quality of research. We review 3 benefits and 3 challenges and provide suggestions from the perspective of ECRs for moving towards open science practices, which we believe scientists and institutions at all levels would do well to consider.},

This transition comes with great benefits but also significant challenges that are likely to affect those who carry out the research, usually early career researchers (ECRs). Here, we describe key benefits, including reputational gains, increased chances of publication, and a broader increase in the reliability of research. The increased chances of publication are supported by exploratory analyses indicating null findings are substantially more likely to be published via open registered reports in comparison to more conventional methods. These benefits are balanced by challenges that we have encountered and that involve increased costs in terms of flexibility, time, and issues with the current incentive structure, all of which seem to affect ECRs acutely. Although there are major obstacles to the early adoption of open science, overall open science practices should benefit both the ECR and improve the quality of research. We review 3 benefits and 3 challenges and provide suggestions from the perspective of ECRs for moving towards open science practices, which we believe scientists and institutions at all levels would do well to consider.},

SUBJECTS/METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar were explored up to  April 2017 for controlled trials investigating the effect of CM on markers of  recovery in trained athletes. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the  systematic review (2, 9, and 1 with high, fair and low quality, respectively) and  11 had extractable data on at least one performance/recovery marker [7 on ratings  of perceived exertion (RPE), 6 on time to exhaustion (TTE) and heart rate (HR), 4  on serum lactate, and serum creatine kinase (CK)]. The meta-analyses revealed  that CM consumption had no effect on TTE, RPE, HR, serum lactate, and CK  (P\,{$>$}\,0.05) compared to placebo or other sport drinks. Subgroup analysis revealed  that TTE significantly increases after consumption of CM compared to placebo  [mean difference (MD)\,=\,0.78\,min, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.27, 1.29,  P\,=\,0.003] and carbohydrate, protein, and fat-containing beverages  (MD\,=\,6.13\,min, 95\% CI: 0.11, 12.15, P\,=\,0.046).

CONCLUSION: CM provides  either similar or superior results when compared to placebo or other recovery  drinks.

Psychologists often want to study effects that are large enough to make a difference to people's subjective experience. Thus, subjective experience is one way to gauge the meaningfulness of an effect. We propose and illustrate one method for how to quantify the smallest subjectively experienced difference---the smallest change in an outcome measure that individuals consider to be meaningful enough in their subjective experience such that they are willing to rate themselves as feeling different---using an anchor-based method with a global rating of change question applied to the positive and negative affect scale. We provide a step-by-step guide for the questions that researchers need to consider in deciding whether and how to use the anchor-based method, and we make explicit the assumptions of the method that future research can examine. For researchers interested in people's subjective experiences, this anchor-based method provides one way to specify a smallest effect size of interest, which allows researchers to interpret observed results in terms of their theoretical and practical significance.},

  abstract = {Minimal measurement error (reliability) during the collection of interval- and ratio-type data is critically important to sports medicine research. The main components of measurement error are systematic bias (e.g. general learning or fatigue effects on the tests) and random error due to biological or mechanical variation. Both error components should be meaningfully quantified for the sports physician to relate the described error to judgements regarding 'analytical goals' (the requirements of the measurement tool for effective practical use) rather than the statistical significance of any reliability indicators. Methods based on correlation coefficients and regression provide an indication of 'relative reliability'. Since these methods are highly influenced by the range of measured values, researchers should be cautious in: (i) concluding acceptable relative reliability even if a correlation is above 0.9; (ii) extrapolating the results of a test-retest correlation to a new sample of individuals involved in an experiment; and (iii) comparing test-retest correlations between different reliability studies. Methods used to describe 'absolute reliability' include the standard error of measurements (SEM), coefficient of variation (CV) and limits of agreement (LOA). These statistics are more appropriate for comparing reliability between different measurement tools in different studies. They can be used in multiple retest studies from ANOVA procedures, help predict the magnitude of a 'real' change in individual athletes and be employed to estimate statistical power for a repeated-measures experiment. These methods vary considerably in the way they are calculated and their use also assumes the presence (CV) or absence (SEM) of heteroscedasticity. Most methods of calculating SEM and CV represent approximately 68\% of the error that is actually present in the repeated measurements for the 'average' individual in the sample. LOA represent the test-retest differences for 95\% of a population. The associated Bland-Altman plot shows the measurement error schematically and helps to identify the presence of heteroscedasticity. If there is evidence of heteroscedasticity or non-normality, one should logarithmically transform the data and quote the bias and random error as ratios. This allows simple comparisons of reliability across different measurement tools. It is recommended that sports clinicians and researchers should cite and interpret a number of statistical methods for assessing reliability. We encourage the inclusion of the LOA method, especially the exploration of heteroscedasticity that is inherent in this analysis. We also stress the importance of relating the results of any reliability statistic to 'analytical goals' in sports medicine.},

We encourage the inclusion of the LOA method, especially the exploration of heteroscedasticity that is inherent in this analysis. We also stress the importance of relating the results of any reliability statistic to 'analytical goals' in sports medicine.},

The results obtained by the teams differed extensively. Many concluded from this widely noted exercise that the social sciences are not rigorous enough to provide definitive answers. In this article, we investigate why results diverged so much. We argue that the main reason was an unclear research question: Teams differed in their interpretation of the research question and therefore used diverse research designs and model specifications. We show by reanalyzing the data that with a clear research question, a precise definition of the parameter of interest, and theory-guided causal reasoning, results vary only within a narrow range. The broad conclusion of our reanalysis is that social science research needs to be more precise in its ``estimands'' to become credible.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: New therapeutic options are needed for patients with psoriasis. Tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor, is being investigated as a treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In this study, we aimed to compare two tofacitinib doses with high-dose etanercept or placebo in this patient population. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, 12-week, non-inferiority trial, adult patients with chronic stable plaque psoriasis (for {$\geq$}12 months) who were candidates for systemic or phototherapy and had a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 12 or higher and a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of moderate or severe, and had failed to respond to, had a contraindication to, or were intolerant to at least one conventional systemic therapy, were enrolled from 122 investigational dermatology centres worldwide. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to receive tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily at about 12 h intervals, etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly at about 3-4 day intervals, or placebo. Randomisation was done by a computer-generated randomisation schedule, and all patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients at week 12 with at least a 75\% reduction in the PASI score from baseline (PASI75 response) and the proportion of patients achieving a PGA score of "clear" or "almost clear" (PGA response), analysed in the full analysis set (all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of study drug). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01241591. FINDINGS: Between Nov 29, 2010, and Sept 13, 2012, we enrolled 1106 eligible adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and randomly assigned them to the four treatment groups (330 to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, 332 to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily, 336 to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly, and 108 to placebo). Of these patients, 1101 actually received their assigned study medication (329 in the tofactinib 5 mg group, 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 335 in the etanercept group, and 107 in the placebo group). At week 12, PASI75 responses were recorded in 130 (39{$\cdot$}5\%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, 210 (63{$\cdot$}6\%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 197 (58{$\cdot$}8\%) of 335 in the etanercept group, and six (5{$\cdot$}6\%) of 107 in the placebo group. A PGA response was achieved by 155 (47{$\cdot$}1\%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, 225 (68{$\cdot$}2\%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 222 (66{$\cdot$}3\%) of 335 in the etanercept group, and 16 (15{$\cdot$}0\%) of 107 in the placebo group. The rate of adverse events was similar across the four groups, with serious adverse events occurring in seven (2\%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, five (2\%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, seven (2\%) of 335 in the etanercept group, and two (2\%) of 107 in the placebo group. Three (1\%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, ten (3\%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 11 (3\%) of 335 in the etanercept group, and four (4\%) of 107 patients in the placebo group discontinued their assigned treatment because of adverse events. INTERPRETATION: In patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, the 10 mg twice daily dose of tofacitinib was non-inferior to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly and was superior to placebo, but the 5 mg twice daily dose did not show non-inferiority to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly. The adverse event rates over 12 weeks were similar for tofacitinib and etanercept. This study indicates that in the future tofacitinib could provide a convenient and well-tolerated therapeutic option for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. FUNDING: Pfizer Inc.},

However, many clinicians and decision-makers may be unfamiliar with the underlying principles and assumptions made within meta-regression leading to incorrect interpretation of their results. Aims: This paper reviews the appropriate use and interpretation of meta-regression in the medical literature, including cautions and caveats to its use. Materials \& Methods: A literature search of MEDLINE (OVID) from 1966-February 2009 was conducted to identify literature relevant to the topic of heterogeneity and/or meta-regression in systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Results: Meta-analysis, a statistical method of pooling data from studies included in a systematic review, is often compromised by heterogeneity of its results. This could include clinical, methodological or statistical heterogeneity. Meta-regression, said to be a merging of meta-analytic and linear regression principles, is a more sophisticated tool for exploring heterogeneity. It aims to discern whether a linear relationship exists between an outcome measure and on or more covariates. The associations found in a meta-regression should be considered hypothesis generating and not regarded as proof of causality. Conclusions: The current review will enable clinicians and healthcare decision-makers to appropriately interpret the results of meta-regression when used within the constructs of a systematic review, and be able to extend it to their clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Researchers face many, often seemingly arbitrary, choices in formulating hypotheses, designing protocols, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting results. Opportunistic use of ``researcher degrees of freedom'' aimed at obtaining statistical significance increases the likelihood of obtaining and publishing false-positive results and overestimated effect sizes. Preregistration is a mechanism for reducing such degrees of freedom by specifying designs and analysis plans before observing the research outcomes. The effectiveness of preregistration may depend, in part, on whether the process facilitates sufficiently specific articulation of such plans. In this preregistered study, we compared 2 formats of preregistration available on the OSF: Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration and Prereg Challenge Registration (now called ``OSF Preregistration,'' http://osf.io/prereg/). The Prereg Challenge format was a ``structured'' workflow with detailed instructions and an independent review to confirm completeness; the ``Standard'' format was ``unstructured'' with minimal direct guidance to give researchers flexibility for what to prespecify. Results of comparing random samples of 53 preregistrations from each format indicate that the ``structured'' format restricted the opportunistic use of researcher degrees of freedom better (Cliff's Delta = 0.49) than the ``unstructured'' format, but neither eliminated all researcher degrees of freedom. We also observed very low concordance among coders about the number of hypotheses (14\%), indicating that they are often not clearly stated. We conclude that effective preregistration is challenging, and registration formats that provide effective guidance may improve the quality of research., Researchers face many, often seemingly arbitrary choices in formulating hypotheses, designing protocols, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting results. A study of two formats of preregistration available on the OSF reveals that the opportunistic use of researcher degrees of freedom aimed at obtaining statistical significance is restricted by using more extensive preregistration guidelines; however, these guidelines should be further improved.},

  abstract = {If science were a game, a dominant rule would probably be to collect results that are statistically significant. Several reviews of the psychological literature have shown that around 96\% of papers involving the use of null hypothesis significance testing report significant outcomes for their main results but that the typical studies are insufficiently powerful for such a track record. We explain this paradox by showing that the use of several small underpowered samples often represents a more efficient research strategy (in terms of finding p {$<$} .05) than does the use of one larger (more powerful) sample. Publication bias and the most efficient strategy lead to inflated effects and high rates of false positives, especially when researchers also resorted to questionable research practices, such as adding participants after intermediate testing. We provide simulations that highlight the severity of such biases in meta-analyses. We consider 13 meta-analyses covering 281 primary studies in various fields of psychology and find indications of biases and/or an excess of significant results in seven. These results highlight the need for sufficiently powerful replications and changes in journal policies.},

Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15\% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers' expectations. We classified the most common errors and contacted authors to shed light on the origins of the errors.},

We surveyed first and corresponding authors of publications in the top-20 journals in communication science. Many researchers report using one or more QRPs. We find widespread pluralistic ignorance: QRPs are generally rejected, but researchers believe they are prevalent. At the same time, we find optimism about the use of open science practices. In all, our study has implications for theories in communication that rely upon a cumulative body of empirical work: these theories are negatively affected by QRPs but can gain credibility if based upon ORPs.

We compared the sample size descriptions from two sources: (i) a sample of pre-registrations created according to the guidelines for the Center for Open Science Preregistration Challenge (PCRs) and a sample of institutional review board (IRB) proposals from Tilburg School of Behavior and Social Sciences, which both include a recommendation to do a formal power analysis, and (ii) a sample of pre-registrations created according to the guidelines for Open Science Framework Standard Pre-Data Collection Registrations (SPRs) in which no guidance on sample size planning is given. We found that PCRs and IRBs (72\%) more often included sample size decisions based on power analyses than the SPRs (45\%). However, this did not result in larger planned sample sizes. The determined sample size of the PCRs and IRB proposals (Md = 90.50) was not higher than the determined sample size of the SPRs (Md = 126.00; W = 3389.5, p = 0.936). Typically, power analyses in the registrations were conducted with G*power, assuming a medium effect size, {$\alpha$} = .05 and a power of .80. Only 20\% of the power analyses contained enough information to fully reproduce the results and only 62\% of these power analyses pertained to the main hypothesis test in the pre-registration. Therefore, we see ample room for improvements in the quality of the registrations and we offer several recommendations to do so.},

  abstract = {Authors have highlighted for decades that sample size justification through power analysis is the exception rather than the rule. Even when authors do report a power analysis, there is often no justification for the smallest effect size of interest, or they do not provide enough information for the analysis to be reproducible. We argue one potential reason for these omissions is the lack of a truly accessible introduction to the key concepts and decisions behind power analysis. In this tutorial targeted at complete beginners, we demonstrate a priori and sensitivity power analysis using jamovi for two independent samples and two dependent samples. Respectively, these power analyses allow you to ask the questions: ``How many participants do I need to detect a given effect size?'', and ``What effect sizes can I detect with a given sample size?''. We emphasise how power analysis is most effective as a reflective process during the planning phase of research to balance your inferential goals with your resources. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to understand the fundamental concepts behind power analysis and extend them to more advanced statistical models.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses are essential for cumulative science, but their validity can be compromised by publication bias. To mitigate the impact of publication bias, one may apply publication-bias-adjustment techniques such as precision-effect test and precision-effect estimate with standard errors (PET-PEESE) and selection models. These methods, implemented in JASP and R, allow researchers without programming experience to conduct state-of-the-art publication-bias-adjusted meta-analysis. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to conduct a publication-bias-adjusted meta-analysis in JASP and R and interpret the results. First, we explain two frequentist bias-correction methods: PET-PEESE and selection models. Second, we introduce robust Bayesian meta-analysis, a Bayesian approach that simultaneously considers both PET-PEESE and selection models. We illustrate the methodology on an example data set, provide an instructional video (https://bit.ly/pubbias) and an R-markdown script (https://osf.io/uhaew/), and discuss the interpretation of the results. Finally, we include concrete guidance on reporting the meta-analytic results in an academic article.},

Recent replication failures have fueled concerns that many published results are false-positives. Brunner and Schimmack (2020) developed z-curve, a method for estimating the expected replication rate (ERR) -- the predicted success rate of exact replication studies based on the mean power after selection for significance. This article introduces an extension of this method, z-curve 2.0. The main extension is an estimate of the expected discovery rate (EDR) -- the estimate of a proportion that the reported statistically significant results constitute from all conducted statistical tests. This information can be used to detect and quantify the amount of selection bias by comparing the EDR to the observed discovery rate (ODR; observed proportion of statistically significant results). In addition, we examined the performance of bootstrapped confidence intervals in simulation studies. Based on these results, we created robust confidence intervals with good coverage across a wide range of scenarios to provide information about the uncertainty in EDR and ERR estimates. We implemented the method in the zcurve R package (Barto{\v s} \&amp; Schimmack, 2020).},

The approach to multivariate meta-analysis presented here can be applied regardless of the form of the effect of interest (be it an effect size, correlation, proportion, or some other index). In general, the goals of a multivariate meta-analysis are the same as those of univariate syntheses: to estimate magnitudes of effect across studies, and to examine variation in patterns of outcomes. Often the reviewer hopes to explain between-study differences in effect magnitudes using explanatory variables. The chapter begins with a brief description of how multivariate data arise in meta-analysis and the potential benefits and problems associated with several approaches to analyzing such data. I then discuss in detail how to conduct a meta-analysis in which one models the dependence in multivariate meta-analysis data. Effect-size and correlational data are given the most thorough treatment, as these are the two most common forms of multivariate meta-analysis data. Examples are drawn from two existing research syntheses. These methods should lead to more informative reviews, based in full knowledge of the complexity of the accumulated evidence.

A double-blind, randomized, crossover design was used to investigate the effects of buccal caffeine supplementation on early morning shot put execution in nine inter-collegiate track and field athletes. In one condition the participants received a piece of caffeinated gum designed to deliver 100 mg of caffeine in a buccal manner, and in a second condition a placebo gum. The gum was chewed for 5 min before being discarded. Participants then completed the first psychomotor vigilance task followed by a series of five warm-up throws, followed by six attempts with a shot put (7.26 kg for males, 4.0 kg for females) measured for distance. The protocol ended with a final psychomotor vigilance task. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (treatment*time) was used to compare performance between the caffeine and placebo treatments over the six measured attempts. A significant difference (treatment{\texttimes}throw) was observed (P=0.030, partial eta-squared = 0.259), indicating that the caffeine treatment produced better performance over the course of the six attempts subsequent to a warm-up. A paired samples t-test (Bonferroni-adjusted for multiple comparisons) revealed that the first attempt in the caffeine treatment (9.62{\textpm}1.71 m) and in the placebo treatment (9.05{\textpm}1.69 m) were significantly different (P = 0.050, effect size = 0.996, 95\%CI 1.02 to 0.13 m). Repeated-measures analysis of covariance revealed a significant (P=0.016, partial eta-squared = 0.650) interaction effect (treatment{\texttimes}mean reaction time), whereby both at the pre and post time points the mean reaction time on the psychomotor vigilance task was reduced under the caffeine treatment (caffeine: pre 0.306{\textpm}0.05 s, post 0.316{\textpm}0.08 s; placebo: pre 0.317{\textpm}0.06 s, post 0.323{\textpm}0.06 s). Based on these results, we suggest that caffeine gum can be beneficial for both performance and alertness if used by shot put athletes during early morning sessions.},

Forty-six trained adults were randomised to a movement quality-focused training (MQ) or a traditional resistance training (TRAD) group, and performed two individualised training sessions per week, for 8 weeks. Session-RPE (sRPE) was obtained from each session. Measures of movement quality (MovementSCREEN and Functional Movement Screen (FMS)) and physical performance were performed pre- and post-intervention. All measures improved significantly in both groups (3--14.5\%, p = {$<$}0.005). The between-group difference in MovementSCREEN composite score was not statistically significant (0.3, 95\% CI -3.4, 4.1, p = 0.852). However, change in FMS composite was significantly greater in MQ (1.3, 95\% CI 0.8, 1.8, p {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in physical performance (p = 0.060--0.960). The mean sRPE was significantly lower in MQ (5.25, SD 1.2) compared to TRAD (6.6 SD 1.0, p = {$<$}0.001). Thus, although movement quality scores were not distinctly greater in the MQ group, a movement quality specific intervention caused comparable improvements in physical performance compared to traditional resistance training but at lower perceived training intensity.},

Additionally, under the current Neyman-Pearson statistical structure, some argue that null hypothesis significant testing (NHST) under the frequentist approach is flawed, regardless. For example, a p-value is unable to measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, unable to measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result, and unable to provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis. Many of these downfalls are key questions researchers strive to answer following an investigation. Therefore, a shift towards a magnitude-based inference model, and eventually a fully Bayesian framework, is thought to be a better fit from a statistical standpoint and may be an improved way to address biases within the literature. The goal of this article is to shed light on the current research and statistical shortcomings the field of sport science faces today, and offer potential solutions to help guide future research practices.},

The culprit is widely held to be poor science: questionable research practices, failure to publish negative results, bad incentives, and even fraud. In this article I argue that the high rate of failed replications is consistent with high-quality science. We would expect this outcome if the field of science in question produces a high proportion of false hypotheses prior to testing. If most of the hypotheses under test are false, then there will be many false hypotheses that are apparently supported by the outcomes of well conducted experiments and null hypothesis significance tests with a type-I error rate ({$\alpha$}) of 5\%. Failure to recognize this is to commit the fallacy of ignoring the base rate. I argue that this is a plausible diagnosis of the replication crisis and examine what lessons we thereby learn for the future conduct of science. 1.1.~ The replication crisis 1.2.~ The base rate fallacy 2.~ From the Base Rate Fallacy to the Replication Crisis 3.~ Explaining the `Replication Crisis: Low {$\pi$} and Non-negligible {$\alpha$} 3.1.~ Science with low {$\pi$} 3.2.~ The value of {$\alpha$}: Type-I errors 4.~ Other Explanations of the Crisis 4.1.~ Low statistical power 4.2.~ Publication bias 4.3.~ Bias, questionable research practices, and fraud 5.~ What Is to Be Done? 5.1.~ Quietism: This is the nature of science 5.2.~ Higher quality hypotheses 5.3.~ Decrease {$\alpha$} 6.~ Conclusion},

Approaches to tackling this crisis include better training in statistical methods, greater transparency and openness, and changes to the incentives created by funding agencies, journals, and institutions. Here, I argue that if proposed solutions are to be effective, we also need to take into account human cognitive constraints that can distort all stages of the research process, including design and execution of experiments, analysis of data, and writing up findings for publication. I focus specifically on cognitive schemata in perception and memory, confirmation bias, systematic misunderstanding of statistics, and asymmetry in moral judgements of errors of commission and omission. Finally, I consider methods that may help mitigate the effect of cognitive constraints: better training, including use of simulations to overcome statistical misunderstanding; specific programmes directed at inoculating against cognitive biases; adoption of Registered Reports to encourage more critical reflection in planning studies; and using methods such as triangulation and ``pre mortem'' evaluation of study design to foster a culture of dialogue and criticism.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify the effects of a single 30~min partial lower leg external pneumatic compression (EPC) treatment compared to a static compression (SC) garment or a no treatment control (CTL) on markers of recovery and performance following a muscle damaging protocol. METHODS: Thirty healthy, active males~(23\,{\textpm}\,3~years; 180.2\,{\textpm}\,9.0~cm; 81.6\,{\textpm}\,11.3~kg) performed 100 drop jumps from a 0.6~m box followed by a randomized, single 30~min treatment of either a partial lower leg EPC device worn below the knee and above the ankle (110~mmHg), SC garment (20-30~mmHg) covering the foot and calf just below the knee, or no treatment CTL, and then returned 24 and 48~h later. Participants were assessed for measures of muscle soreness, fatigue, hemodynamics, blood lactate, muscle thickness, circumferences, and performance assessments. RESULTS: The drop jump protocol significantly increased muscle soreness (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), fatigue (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), blood flow (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), hemoglobin (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and muscle oxygen saturation (SMO2; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Countermovement jump and squat jump testing completed after treatment with either EPC, SC, or CTL revealed no differences for jump height between any condition. However, EPC treatment maintained consistent braking force and propulsive power measures across all timepoints for countermovement jump testing. EPC and SC treatment also led to better maintenance of squat jump performance for average relative propulsive force and power variables at 24 and 48~h compared to CTL. CONCLUSIONS: A single 30~min partial leg EPC treatment may lead to more consistent jump performance following a damaging bout of exercise.},

  abstract = {The way in which we assess researchers has been under the radar in the past few years. Critics argue that current research assessments focus on productivity and that they increase unhealthy pressures on scientists. Yet, the precise ways in which assessments should change is still open for debate. We circulated a survey with Flemish researchers to understand how they work, and how they would rate the relevance of specific indicators used in research assessments. We found that most researchers worked far beyond their expected working schedule. We also found that, although they spent most of their time doing research, respondents wished they could dedicate more time to it and spend less time writing grants and performing other activities such as administrative duties and meetings. When looking at success indicators, we found that indicators related to openness, transparency, quality, and innovation were perceived as highly important in advancing science, but as relatively overlooked in career advancement. Conversely, indicators which denoted of prestige and competition were generally rated as important to career advancement, but irrelevant or even detrimental in advancing science. Open comments from respondents further revealed that, although indicators which indicate openness, transparency, and quality (e.g., publishing open access, publishing negative findings, sharing data, etc.) should ultimately be valued more in research assessments, the resources and support currently in place were insufficient to allow researchers to endorse such practices. In other words, current research assessments are inadequate and ignore practices which are essential in contributing to the advancement of science. Yet, before we change the way in which researchers are being assessed, supporting infrastructures must be put in place to ensure that researchers are able to commit to the activities that may benefit the advancement of science.},

A treatment that has a moderate clinical impact in all studies is very different than a treatment where the impact is moderate on average, but in some studies is large and in others is trivial (or even harmful). A treatment that has no impact in any studies is very different than a treatment that has no impact on average because it is helpful in some studies but harmful in others. The majority of meta-analyses use the I-squared index to quantify heterogeneity. While this practice is common it is nevertheless incorrect. I-squared does not tell us how much the effect size varies (except when I-squared is zero percent). The statistic that does convey this information is the prediction interval. It allows us to report, for example, that a treatment has a clinically trivial or moderate effect in roughly 10~\% of studies, a large effect in roughly 50~\%, and a very large effect in roughly 40~\%. This is the information that researchers or clinicians have in mind when they ask about heterogeneity. It is the information that researchers believe (incorrectly) is provided by I-squared.},

While large-scale studies often employ subgroup analyses, these analyses cannot generally be performed for small-scale studies, since these typically include a homogeneous population and only one variant of the intervention. This limitation can be bypassed by using meta-analysis. Meta-analysis allows the researcher to compare the treatment effect in different subgroups, even if these subgroups appear in separate studies. We discuss several statistical issues related to this procedure, including the selection of a statistical model and statistical power for the comparison. To illustrate these points, we use the example of a meta-analysis of obesity prevention.},

METHODS: The abstracts of 48,390 articles, published in 18 sports and exercise medicine journals between 2002 and 2022, were searched using a validated text-mining algorithm that identified and extracted ratio confidence intervals (odds, hazard, and risk ratios). The algorithm identified 1744 abstracts that included ratio confidence intervals, from which 4484 intervals were extracted. After excluding ineligible intervals, the analysis used 3819 intervals, reported as 95\,\% confidence intervals, from 1599 articles. The cumulative distributions of lower and upper confidence limits were plotted to identify any abnormal patterns, particularly around a ratio of 1 (the null hypothesis). The distributions were compared to those from unbiased reference data, which was not subjected to p-hacking or publication bias. A bias for statistical significance was further investigated using a histogram plot of z-values calculated from the extracted 95\,\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: There was a marked change in the cumulative distribution of lower and upper bound intervals just over and just under a ratio of 1. The bias for statistical significance was also clear in a stark under-representation of z-values between -1.96 and +1.96, corresponding to p-values above 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: There was an excess of published research with statistically significant results just below the standard significance threshold of 0.05, which is indicative of publication bias. Transparent research practices, including the use of registered reports, are needed to reduce the bias in published research.},

In comparison, confidence intervals reflect the uncertainty around the point estimate but provide an incomplete summary of the underlying heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. This study aimed to estimate (i) the proportion of meta-analysis studies that report a prediction interval in sports medicine; and (ii) the proportion of studies with a discrepancy between the reported confidence interval and a calculated prediction interval. Methods We screened, at random, 1500 meta-analysis studies published between 2012 and 2022 in highly ranked sports medicine and medical journals. Articles that used a random effect meta-analysis model were included in the study. We randomly selected one meta-analysis from each article to extract data from, which included the number of estimates, the pooled effect, and the confidence and prediction interval. Results Of the 1500 articles screened, 866 (514 from sports medicine) used a random effect model. The probability of a prediction interval being reported in sports medicine was 1.7\% (95\% CI = 0.9\%, 3.3\%). In medicine the probability was 3.9\% (95\% CI = 2.4\%, 6.6\%). A prediction interval was able to be calculated for 220 sports medicine studies. For 60\% of these studies, there was a discrepancy in study findings between the reported confidence interval and the calculated prediction interval. Prediction intervals were 3.4 times wider than confidence intervals. Conclusion Very few meta-analyses report prediction intervals and hence are prone to missing the impact of between-study heterogeneity on the overall conclusions. The widespread misinterpretation of random effect meta-analyses could mean that potentially harmful treatments, or those lacking a sufficient evidence base, are being used in practice. Authors, reviewers, and editors should be aware of the importance of prediction intervals.},

Simulations were used to verify the accuracy of the formula and to improve the approximation for small trials. The sample size calculations are illustrated in a clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis. RESULTS: If the correlation between the outcome measured at baseline and at follow-up is rho, ANCOVA comparing groups of (1-rho(2))n subjects has the same power as t-test comparing groups of n subjects. When on the same data, ANCOVA is used instead of t-test, the precision of the treatment estimate is increased, and the length of the confidence interval is reduced by a factor 1-rho(2). CONCLUSION: ANCOVA may considerably reduce the number of patients required for a trial.},

  abstract = {This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

Thirteen cyclists ({\.V}O2max: 69.7{\textpm}7.1\,ml{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1) underwent a performance assessment and two high-intensity interval training sessions. Both comprised six 5-minute varied-intensity work intervals within which the work rate was alternated between 100\% (3{\texttimes}30-second blocks, with or without vibration) and 77\% of maximal aerobic power (always without vibration). Adding vibration to varied-intensity work intervals did not elicit a longer time above ninety percent of maximal oxygen uptake (415{\textpm}221 versus 399{\textpm}209\,seconds, P=0.69). Heart rate- and perceptual-based training-load metrics were also not affected (all P{$\geq$}0.59). When considering individual work intervals, no between-condition differences were found (fraction of maximal oxygen uptake, P=0.34; total oxygen uptake, P=0.053; mean minute ventilation, P=0.079; mean heart rate, P=0.88; blood lactate concentration, P=0.53; ratings of perceived exertion, P=0.29). Adding intermittent vibration to varied-intensity work intervals does not increase the fraction of maximal oxygen uptake elicited. Whether intermittent exposure to vibration can enhance cyclists' adaptive stimulus triggered by high-intensity interval training remains to be determined.},

Results: Cyclists spent more time at {$>$}90\%V˙O2max during HIIT with varied-intensity work intervals (410 [207] vs 286 [162] s, P\,=\,.02), but there were no differences between sessions in heart-rate- or perceptual-based training-load metrics (all P\,{$\geq$}\,.1). When considering individual work intervals, minute ventilation ( V˙E) was higher in the varied-intensity mode (F\,=\,8.42, P\,=\,.01), but not respiratory frequency, tidal volume, blood lactate concentration [La], ratings of perceived exertion, or cadence (all F\,{$\leq$}\,3.50,\,{$\geq$}\,.08). Absolute changes ({$\Delta$}) between HIIT sessions were calculated per work interval, and {$\Delta$} total oxygen uptake was moderately associated with {$\Delta$}V˙E (r\,=\,.36, P\,=\,.002). Conclusions: In comparison with an HIIT session with constant-intensity work intervals, well-trained cyclists sustain higher fractions of V˙O2max when work intervals involved power-output variations. This effect is partially mediated by an increased oxygen cost of hyperpnea and not associated with a higher [La], perceived exertion, or training-load metrics.},

  abstract = {Manure N from cattle contributes to nitrate leaching, nitrous oxide, and ammonia emissions. Measurement of manure N outputs on commercial beef cattle operations  is laborious, expensive, and impractical; therefore, models are needed to predict  N excreted in urine and feces. Building robust prediction models requires  extensive data from animals under different management systems worldwide. Thus,  the study objectives were to 1) collate an international dataset of N excretion  in feces and urine based on individual observations from beef cattle; 2)  determine the suitability of key variables for predicting fecal, urinary, and  total manure N excretion; and 3) develop robust and reliable N excretion  prediction models based on individual observation from beef cattle consuming  various diets. A meta-analysis based on individual beef data from different  experiments was carried out from a raw dataset including 1,004 observations from  33 experiments collected from 5 research institutes in Europe (n = 3), North  America (n = 1), and South America (n = 1). A sequential approach was taken in  developing models of increasing complexity by incrementally adding significant  variables that affected fecal, urinary, or total manure N excretion. Nitrogen  excretion was predicted by fitting linear mixed models with experiment as a  random effect. Simple models including dry matter intake (DMI) were better at  predicting fecal N excretion than those using only dietary nutrient composition  or body weight (BW). Simple models based on N intake performed better for urinary  and total manure N excretion than those based on DMI. A model including DMI and  dietary component concentrations led to the most robust prediction of fecal and  urinary N excretion, generating root mean square prediction errors as a  percentage of the observed mean values of 25.0\% for feces and 25.6\% for urine.  Complex total manure N excretion models based on BW and dietary component  concentrations led to the lowest prediction errors of about 14.6\%. In conclusion,  several models to predict N excretion already exist, but the ones developed in  this study are based on individual observations encompassing larger variability  than the previous developed models. In addition, models that include information  on DMI or N intake are required for accurate prediction of fecal, urinary, and  total manure N excretion. In the absence of intake data, equations have poor  performance as compared with equations based on intake and dietary component  concentrations.},

The median CI width for d was greater than 1 in both surveys. Hence, CI widths were, as Cohen (1994) speculated, embarrassingly large. Additional exploratory analyses revealed that CI widths varied across psychological research areas and that CI widths were not discernably decreasing over time. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed along with ways of reducing the CI widths and thus improving precision of effect size estimation.},

  abstract = {Most researchers acknowledge an intrinsic hierarchy in the scholarly journals (``journal rank'') that they submit their work to, and adjust not only their submission but also their reading strategies accordingly. On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery functions of the current journal system.},

The underlying common assumption is that only the best scientists manage to publish in a highly selective tier of the most prestigious journals. However, data from several lines of evidence suggest that the methodological quality of scientific experiments does not increase with increasing rank of the journal. On the contrary, an accumulating body of evidence suggests the inverse: methodological quality and, consequently, reliability of published research works in several fields may be decreasing with increasing journal rank. The data supporting these conclusions circumvent confounding factors such as increased readership and scrutiny for these journals, focusing instead on quantifiable indicators of methodological soundness in the published literature, relying on, in part, semi-automated data extraction from often thousands of publications at a time. With the accumulating evidence over the last decade grew the realization that the very existence of scholarly journals, due to their inherent hierarchy, constitutes one of the major threats to publicly funded science: hiring, promoting and funding scientists who publish unreliable science eventually erodes public trust in science.},

We show by means of simulations that even with minimal omitted-variable bias (e.g., unaccounted confounding) p-curves based on true effects and p-curves based on null-effects with p-hacking cannot be reliably distinguished. We also demonstrate this problem using as practical example the evaluation of the effect of malaria prevalence on economic growth between 1960 and 1996. These findings call recent studies into question that use the p-curve to infer that most published research findings are based on true effects in the medical literature and in a wide range of disciplines. p-values in observational research may need to be empirically calibrated to be interpretable with respect to the commonly used significance threshold of 0.05. Violations of randomization in experimental studies may also result in situations where the use of p-curves is similarly unreliable.},

The second section discusses studies where both participants and stimuli are used as sources of random variation, ensuring robust generalization beyond the specific stimuli tested. In our search for standardized effect sizes, we saw that partial eta squared is even less informative for LME than for ANOVA. We present eta squared within as an alternative, to be used in combination with the traditional measure eta squared (also in ANOVA). To facilitate implementation, we analyze toy datasets with R and jamovi.

For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80\%, whereas in practice less than 40\% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants.

While debate continues, MBI is today well established in sport science and in other fields, particularly clinical medicine, where practical/clinical significance often takes priority over statistical significance. In this commentary, some reasons why both academics and sport scientists should abandon null-hypothesis significance testing and embrace MBI are reviewed. Apparent limitations and future areas of research are also discussed. The following arguments are presented: P values and, in turn, study conclusions are sample-size dependent, irrespective of the size of the effect; significance does not inform on magnitude of effects, yet magnitude is what matters the most; MBI allows authors to be honest with their sample size and better acknowledge trivial effects; the examination of magnitudes per se helps provide better research questions; MBI can be applied to assess changes in individuals; MBI improves data visualization; and MBI is supported by spreadsheets freely available on the Internet. Finally, recommendations to define the smallest important effect and improve the presentation of standardized effects are presented.},

However, gaining evidence of the performance benefits of these supplements is a process challenged by the scarcity of research in relation to the number of available products, and the limitations of the poor quality of some studies. While meta-analyses and systematic reviews can help to provide information about the general use of performance supplements, the controlled scientific trial provides the basis on which these reviews are undertaken, as well as an opportunity to address more specific questions about supplement applications. Guidelines for the design of studies include the choice of well-trained athletes who are familiarized with performance tasks that have been chosen on their basis of their known reliability and validity. Supplement protocols should be chosen to maximize the likely benefits, and researchers should also make efforts to control confounding variables, while keeping conditions similar to real-life practices. Performance changes should be interpreted in light of what is meaningful to the outcomes of sporting competition. Issues that have been poorly addressed to date include the use of several supplements in combination and the use of the same supplement over successive events, both within a single, and across multiple competition days. Strategies to isolate and explain the variability of benefits to individuals are also a topic for future investigation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the awareness of academic misconduct has increased due to high-profile scandals involving prominent researchers and a spike in journal retractions. But such examples of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP) serve to obscure the less flagrant, more subtle cases of possible misconduct: what some have called ``questionable research practices'' (QRPs). Where FFP is seen as inherently negative, QRPs fall into an ethical ``gray zone'' between permissible and impermissible. We draw on semistructured interviews with business school scholars to explore the occurrence of QRPs. Prevalent QRPs include playing with numbers, playing with models, and playing with hypotheses. Scholars explain the existence of QRPs in three ways: the inadequate training of researchers, the pressures and incentives to publish in certain outlets, and the demands and expectations of journal editors and reviewers. We argue that a paradox is at work here: To live up to the positivist image of ``pure science'' that appears in academic journals, researchers may find themselves---ironically---transgressing this very ideal. Ultimately, this challenges the individualistic account of academic misconduct by drawing attention to the role played by institutional actors, such as academic journals, in encouraging forms of QRPs.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II) is widely used in research on depression. However, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is unknown. MCID can be estimated in several ways. Here we take a patient-centred approach, anchoring the change on the BDI-II to the patient's global report of improvement.MethodWe used data collected (n = 1039) from three randomized controlled trials for the management of depression. Improvement on a `global rating of change' question was compared with changes in BDI-II scores using general linear modelling to explore baseline dependency, assessing whether MCID is best measured in absolute terms (i.e. difference) or as percent reduction in scores from baseline (i.e. ratio), and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) to estimate MCID according to the optimal threshold above which individuals report feeling `better'.ResultsImprovement in BDI-II scores associated with reporting feeling `better' depended on initial depression severity, and statistical modelling indicated that MCID is best measured on a ratio scale as a percentage reduction of score. We estimated a MCID of a 17.5\% reduction in scores from baseline from ROC analyses. The corresponding estimate for individuals with longer duration depression who had not responded to antidepressants was higher at 32\%.ConclusionsMCID on the BDI-II is dependent on baseline severity, is best measured on a ratio scale, and the MCID for treatment-resistant depression is larger than that for more typical depression. This has important implications for clinical trials and practice.},

Sport and exercise scientists often analyze repeated-measures data, from which mean differences are reported. To aid the interpretation of these data, standardized mean differences (SMD) are commonly reported as a description of effect size. In this manuscript, we hope to alleviate some confusion. First, we provide a philosophical framework for conceptualizing SMDs; that is, by dichotomizing them into two groups: magnitude-based and signal-to-noise SMDs. Second, we describe the statistical properties of SMDs and their implications. Finally, we provide high-level recommendations for how sport and exercise scientists can thoughtfully report raw effect sizes, SMDs, or other effect sizes for their own studies. This conceptual framework provides sport and exercise scientists with the background necessary to make and justify their choice of an SMD.},

  abstract = {The primary means of disseminating sport and exercise science research is currently through journal articles. However, not all studies, especially those with null findings, make it to formal publication. This publication bias towards positive findings may contribute to questionable research practices. Preregistration is a solution to prevent the publication of distorted evidence resulting from this system. This process asks authors to register their hypotheses and methods before data collection on a publicly available repository or by submitting a Registered Report. In the Registered Report format, authors submit a stage 1 manuscript to a participating journal that includes an introduction, methods, and any pilot data indicating the exploratory or confirmatory nature of the study. After a stage 1 peer review, the manuscript can then be offered in-principle acceptance, rejected, or sent back for revisions to improve the quality of the study. If accepted, the project is guaranteed publication, assuming the authors follow the data collection and analysis protocol. After data collection, authors re-submit a stage 2 manuscript that includes the results and discussion, and the study is evaluated on clarity and conformity with the planned analysis. In its final form, Registered Reports appear almost identical to a typical publication, but give readers confidence that the hypotheses and main analyses are less susceptible to bias from questionable research practices. From this perspective, we argue that inclusion of Registered Reports by researchers and journals will improve the transparency, replicability, and trust in sport and exercise science research.

The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies.

Replicability varies between 12 (57\%) and 14 (67\%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67\% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71\%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility.

Selective reporting (only reporting significant results) is one factor contributing to the lack of reliability in published research. Therefore, estimates of food-related ICT effects~may be inaccurate. We conducted p-curve analyses to assess the presence of selective reporting, evidential value, average effect size, and power in the food-related ICT literature. Extracted p-values were selected from articles included in food-related ICT meta-analyses and an updated literature search. Four p-curve analyses resulted in 'U'-shaped distributions, suggesting evidence for both a true underlying effect and selective reporting in the food-related ICT literature. Robust analyses suggested the evidence for an underlying effect was primarily driven by the smallest p-value. The average effect size from included studies was small (d\,=\,0.04 to 0.25). Average power to detect this effect was also small (7\% to 18\%). Results suggest no clear support for or against a true effect for food-related ICT. Low average effect size and power across studies suggests estimated effects are likely inflated in published literature. Higher-powered, pre-registered, longitudinal food-related ICT studies are needed to test for the presence and magnitude of ICT effects.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To date no studies have compared resistance training loading strategies combined with dietary intervention for fat loss. Methods: Thus, we performed a randomised crossover design comparing four weeks of heavier- (HL; {\textasciitilde}80\% 1RM) and lighter-load (LL; {\textasciitilde}60\% 1RM) resistance training, combined with calorie restriction and dietary guidance, including resistance trained participants (n=130; males=49, females=81). Both conditions performed low-volume, (single set of 9 exercises, 2x/week) effort matched (to momentary failure), but non-work-matched protocols. Testing was completed pre- and post-each intervention. Fat mass (kg) was the primary outcome, and a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) was established at 3.3\% loss of baseline bodyweight. Body fat percentage, lean mass, and strength (7-10RM) for chest press, leg press, and pull-down exercises were also measured. An 8-week washout period of traditional training with normal calorie interspersed each intervention. Results: Both interventions showed small statistically equivalent (within the SESOI) reductions in fat mass (HL: -0.67 kg [95\%CI -0.91 to 0.42]; LL: -0.55 kg [95\%CI -0.80 to -0.31]) which were also equivalent between conditions (HL - LL: -0.113 kg [95\%CI -0.437 kg to 0.212 kg]). Changes in body fat percentage and lean mass were also minimal. Strength increases were small, similar between conditions, and within a previously determined SESOI for the population included (10.1\%). Conclusions: Fat loss reductions are not impacted by resistance training load; both HL and LL produce similar, yet small, changes to body composition over a 4-week intervention. However, the maintenance of both lean mass and strength highlights the value of resistance training during dietary intervention.},

This ``fatigue'' can be due both to impaired muscle function, termed ``peripheral fatigue,'' and a reduction in the capacity of the central nervous system to activate muscles, termed ``central fatigue.'' In this review we consider the factors that determine the recovery of voluntary force generating capacity after various types of exercise. After brief, high-intensity exercise there is typically a rapid restitution of force that is due to recovery of central fatigue (typically within 2 min) and aspects of peripheral fatigue associated with excitation-contraction coupling and reperfusion of muscles (typically within 3--5 min). Complete recovery of muscle function may be incomplete for some hours, however, due to prolonged impairment in intracellular Ca               2+               release or sensitivity. After low-intensity exercise of long duration, voluntary force typically shows rapid, partial, recovery within the first few minutes, due largely to recovery of the central, neural component. However, the ability to voluntarily activate muscles may not recover completely within 30 min after exercise. Recovery of peripheral fatigue contributes comparatively little to the fast initial force restitution and is typically incomplete for at least 20--30 min. Work remains to identify what factors underlie the prolonged central fatigue that usually accompanies long-duration single joint and locomotor exercise and to document how the time course of neuromuscular recovery is affected by exercise intensity and duration in locomotor exercise. Such information could be useful to enhance rehabilitation and sports performance.},

  abstract = {Publication bias and questionable research practices in primary research can lead to badly overestimated effects in meta-analysis. Methodologists have proposed a variety of statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is not clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here, we present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of the most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might realistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses---that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications.

  abstract = {Few models of self-control have generated as much scientific interest as has the limited strength model. One of the entailments of this model, the depletion effect, is the expectation that acts of self-control will be less effective when they follow prior acts of self-control. Results from a previous meta-analysis concluded that the depletion effect is robust and medium in magnitude (d = 0.62). However, when we applied methods for estimating and correcting for small-study effects (such as publication bias) to the data from this previous meta-analysis effort, we found very strong signals of publication bias, along with an indication that the depletion effect is actually no different from zero. We conclude that until greater certainty about the size of the depletion effect can be established, circumspection about the existence of this phenomenon is warranted, and that rather than elaborating on the model, research efforts should focus on establishing whether the basic effect exists. We argue that the evidence for the depletion effect is a useful case study for illustrating the dangers of small-study effects as well as some of the possible tools for mitigating their influence in psychological science.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Selective reporting of outcomes within published studies based on the nature or direction of their results has been widely suspected, but direct  evidence of such bias is currently limited to case reports. OBJECTIVE: To study  empirically the extent and nature of outcome reporting bias in a cohort of  randomized trials. DESIGN: Cohort study using protocols and published reports of  randomized trials approved by the Scientific-Ethical Committees for Copenhagen  and Frederiksberg, Denmark, in 1994-1995. The number and characteristics of  reported and unreported trial outcomes were recorded from protocols, journal  articles, and a survey of trialists. An outcome was considered incompletely  reported if insufficient data were presented in the published articles for  meta-analysis. Odds ratios relating the completeness of outcome reporting to  statistical significance were calculated for each trial and then pooled to  provide an overall estimate of bias. Protocols and published articles were also  compared to identify discrepancies in primary outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Completeness of reporting of efficacy and harm outcomes and of statistically  significant vs nonsignificant outcomes; consistency between primary outcomes  defined in the most recent protocols and those defined in published articles.  RESULTS: One hundred two trials with 122 published journal articles and 3736  outcomes were identified. Overall, 50\% of efficacy and 65\% of harm outcomes per  trial were incompletely reported. Statistically significant outcomes had a higher  odds of being fully reported compared with nonsignificant outcomes for both  efficacy (pooled odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.0) and harm  (pooled odds ratio, 4.7; 95\% CI, 1.8-12.0) data. In comparing published articles  with protocols, 62\% of trials had at least 1 primary outcome that was changed,  introduced, or omitted. Eighty-six percent of survey responders (42/49) denied  the existence of unreported outcomes despite clear evidence to the contrary.  CONCLUSIONS: The reporting of trial outcomes is not only frequently incomplete  but also biased and inconsistent with protocols. Published articles, as well as  reviews that incorporate them, may therefore be unreliable and overestimate the  benefits of an intervention. To ensure transparency, planned trials should be  registered and protocols should be made publicly available prior to trial  completion.},

  abstract = {The use and misuse of P values has generated extensive debates. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in large scale the P values reported in the abstracts and full text of biomedical research articles over the past 25 years and determine how frequently statistical information is presented in ways other than P values. DESIGN: Automated text-mining analysis was performed to extract data on P values reported in 12,821,790 MEDLINE abstracts and in 843,884 abstracts and full-text articles in PubMed Central (PMC) from 1990 to 2015. Reporting of P values in 151 English-language core clinical journals and specific article types as classified by PubMed also was evaluated. A random sample of 1000 MEDLINE abstracts was manually assessed for reporting of P values and other types of statistical information; of those abstracts reporting empirical data, 100 articles were also assessed in full text. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: P values reported. RESULTS: Text mining identified 4,572,043 P values in 1,608,736 MEDLINE abstracts and 3,438,299 P values in 385,393 PMC full-text articles. Reporting of P values in abstracts increased from 7.3\% in 1990 to 15.6\% in 2014. In 2014, P values were reported in 33.0\% of abstracts from the 151 core clinical journals (n\,=\,29,725 abstracts), 35.7\% of meta-analyses (n\,=\,5620), 38.9\% of clinical trials (n\,=\,4624), 54.8\% of randomized controlled trials (n\,=\,13,544), and 2.4\% of reviews (n\,=\,71,529). The distribution of reported P values in abstracts and in full text showed strong clustering at P values of .05 and of .001 or smaller. Over time, the "best" (most statistically significant) reported P values were modestly smaller and the "worst" (least statistically significant) reported P values became modestly less significant. Among the MEDLINE abstracts and PMC full-text articles with P values, 96\% reported at least 1 P value of .05 or lower, with the proportion remaining steady over time in PMC full-text articles. In 1000 abstracts that were manually reviewed, 796 were from articles reporting empirical data; P values were reported in 15.7\% (125/796 [95\% CI, 13.2\%-18.4\%]) of abstracts, confidence intervals in 2.3\% (18/796 [95\% CI, 1.3\%-3.6\%]), Bayes factors in 0\% (0/796 [95\% CI, 0\%-0.5\%]), effect sizes in 13.9\% (111/796 [95\% CI, 11.6\%-16.5\%]), other information that could lead to estimation of P values in 12.4\% (99/796 [95\% CI, 10.2\%-14.9\%]), and qualitative statements about significance in 18.1\% (181/1000 [95\% CI, 15.8\%-20.6\%]); only 1.8\% (14/796 [95\% CI, 1.0\%-2.9\%]) of abstracts reported at least 1 effect size and at least 1 confidence interval. Among 99 manually extracted full-text articles with data, 55 reported P values, 4 presented confidence intervals for all reported effect sizes, none used Bayesian methods, 1 used false-discovery rates, 3 used sample size/power calculations, and 5 specified the primary outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this analysis of P values reported in MEDLINE abstracts and in PMC articles from 1990-2015, more MEDLINE abstracts and articles reported P values over time, almost all abstracts and articles with P values reported statistically significant results, and, in a subgroup analysis, few articles included confidence intervals, Bayes factors, or effect sizes. Rather than reporting isolated P values, articles should include effect sizes and uncertainty metrics.},

Their aim is twofold: to raise awareness about potential issues in the practical application of these metrics; and to offer critique about and, they hope, "quality" to the writing and rhetoric concerning how to measure publication impact and quality.}

These ad-hoc approaches, however, may lead to missed opportunities to utilize all available data to address the relevant research questions. Both multivariate meta-analysis and three-level meta-analysis have been proposed to handle non-independent effect sizes. This paper gives a brief introduction to these new techniques for applied researchers. The first objective is to highlight the benefits of using these methods to address non-independent effect sizes. The second objective is to illustrate how to apply these techniques with real data in R and Mplus. Researchers may modify the sample R and Mplus code to fit their data.},

Most meta-analytic models assume independence among effect sizes. However, effect sizes can be dependent for various reasons. For example, studies might report multiple effect sizes on the same construct, and effect sizes reported by participants from the same cultural group are likely to be more similar than those reported by other cultural groups. This article reviews the problems and common methods to handle dependent effect sizes. The objective of this article is to demonstrate how 3-level meta-analyses can be used to model dependent effect sizes. The advantages of the structural equation modeling approach over the multilevel approach with regard to conducting a 3-level meta-analysis are discussed. This article also seeks to extend the key concepts of Q statistics, I2, and R2 from 2-level meta-analyses to 3-level meta-analyses. The proposed procedures are implemented using the open source metaSEM package for the R statistical environment. Two real data sets are used to illustrate these procedures. New research directions related to 3-level meta-analyses are discussed.},

CWI seems to benefit the acute recovery of endurance performance, and longer-term  recovery of muscle strength and power, coinciding with changes in muscle damage  markers. This, however, depends on the nature of the preceding exercise.},

One probable reason for this overuse of two-tailed testing is the seemingly valid beliefs that two-tailed testing is more conservative and safer than one-tailed testing. However, the authors examine the legitimacy of this notion and find it to be flawed. A second and more fundamental cause of the current problem is the pervasive oversight in making a clear distinction between the research hypothesis and the statistical hypothesis. Based upon the explicated, sound relationship between the research and statistical hypotheses, the authors propose a new scheme of hypothesis classification to facilitate and clarify the proper use of statistical hypothesis testing in empirical research.},

In addition, our meta-analysis of all the primary RCTs included in the revised meta-analyses shows small exercise-related benefits (d\,=\,0.22, 95\% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.28) that became substantially smaller after accounting for key moderators (that is, active control and baseline differences; d\,=\,0.13, 95\% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.20), and negligible after correcting for publication bias (d\,=\,0.05, 95\% confidence interval -0.09 to 0.14).

In this paper, we have investigated adherence and disclosure of deviations for all articles published with the Preregistered badge in Psychological Science between February 2015 and November 2017 and shared our findings with the corresponding authors for feedback. Two out of 27 preregistered studies contained no deviations from the preregistration plan. In one study, all deviations were disclosed. Nine studies disclosed none of the deviations. We mainly observed (un)disclosed deviations from the plan regarding the reported sample size, exclusion criteria and statistical analysis. This closer look at preregistrations of the first generation reveals possible hurdles for reporting preregistered studies and provides input for future reporting guidelines. We discuss the results and possible explanations, and provide recommendations for preregistered research.},

  abstract = {Introduction~           Exercise with low carbohydrate availability increases protein degradation, which may reduce subsequent performance considerably. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of carbohydrate ingestion during standardized exercise with and without exhaustion on protein degradation and next-day performance.           Methods~           Seven trained male cyclists (VO2max 66.8 {\textpm} 1.9 mL{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1; mean {\textpm} SEM) cycled to exhaustion ({\textasciitilde}2.5 hours) at a power output eliciting 68\% of VO2max (W68\%). This was followed by repeating 1-min work/1-min recovery intervals at 90\% of VO2max (W90\%) until exhaustion. During W68\%, cyclists consumed a placebo water drink (PLA) the first time and a carbohydrate drink (CHO), 1 g carbohydrate{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}h-1, the second time. The participants performed the same amount of work under the two conditions, separated by at least one week. A standardized diet was provided to the participants so that the two conditions were isoenergetic. To test the impact of carbohydrates on recovery, participants completed a time trial (TT) the next day.           Results~           Carbohydrate ingestion maintained carbohydrate availability during W68\% and W90\%: total carbohydrate oxidation was significantly higher in CHO (p = 0.022), and plasma glucose concentration was maintained compared to PLA (p = 0.025). Next-day performance during TT was better after CHO ingestion (CHO, 41:49 {\textpm} 1:38 min; PLA, 42:50 {\textpm} 1:46 min; p = 0.020; effect size d = 0.23, small), as was gross efficiency (CHO, 18.6 {\textpm} 0.3 \%; PLA, 17.9 {\textpm} 0.3 \%; p = 0.019). Urinary nitrogen excretion (p = 0.897) and urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion (p = 0.673) did not significantly differ during the study period. Finally, tyrosine and phenylalanine plasma concentrations increased in PLA but not in CHO (p = 0.018).           Conclusions~           Carbohydrate ingestion during exhaustive exercise reduced deterioration in next-day performance through reduced metabolic stress and development of fatigue. In addition, some parameters point toward less protein degradation, which would preserve muscle function.},

However, other factors beyond significance levels can contribute to publication bias. Some of these factors include study characteristics, such as the source of funding for the research project, whether the project was single center or multicenter, and prevailing theories at the time of publication. This article examines the relationship between publication bias and 2 study characteristics by breaking down 2 meta-analytic data sets into levels of the relevant study characteristic and assessing publication bias in each level with funnel plots, trim and fill (Duval \& Tweedie, 2000a, 2000b), Egger's linear regression (Egger, Smith, Schneider, \& Minder, 1997), cumulative meta-analysis (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, \& Rothstein, 2009), and the Vevea and Hedges (1995) weight-function model. Using the Vevea and Hedges model, we conducted likelihood ratio tests to determine whether information was lost if only 1 pattern of selection was estimated. Results indicate that publication bias can differ over levels of study characteristics, and that developing a model to accommodate this relationship could be advantageous.},

It is hopeless to expect users to change their reliance on p-values unless they are offered an alternative way of judging the reliability of their conclusions. If the alternative method is to have a chance of being adopted widely, it will have to be easy to understand and to calculate. One such proposal is based on calculation of false positive risk(FPR). It is suggested that p-values and confidence intervals should continue to be given, but that they should be supplemented by a single additional number that conveys the strength of the evidence better than the p-value. This number could be the minimum FPR (that calculated on the assumption of a prior probability of 0.5, the largest value that can be assumed in the absence of hard prior data). Alternatively one could specify the prior probability that it would be necessary to believe in order to achieve an FPR of, say, 0.05.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The randomised controlled trial (RCT) is widely considered to be the gold standard study for comparing the effectiveness of health interventions. Central to the design and validity of a RCT is a calculation of the number of participants needed (the sample size). The value used to determine the sample size can be considered the 'target difference'. From both a scientific and an ethical standpoint, selecting an appropriate target difference is of crucial importance. Determination of the target difference, as opposed to statistical approaches to calculating the sample size, has been greatly neglected though a variety of approaches have been proposed the current state of the evidence is unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to provide an overview of the current evidence regarding specifying the target difference in a RCT sample size calculation. The specific objectives were to conduct a systematic review of methods for specifying a target difference; to evaluate current practice by surveying triallists; to develop guidance on specifying the target difference in a RCT; and to identify future research needs. DESIGN: The biomedical and social science databases searched were MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index, EconLit, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Scopus for in-press publications. All were searched from 1966 or the earliest date of the database coverage and searches were undertaken between November 2010 and January 2011. There were three interlinked components: (1) systematic review of methods for specifying a target difference for RCTs - a comprehensive search strategy involving an electronic literature search of biomedical and some non-biomedical databases and clinical trials textbooks was carried out; (2) identification of current trial practice using two surveys of triallists - members of the Society for Clinical Trials (SCT) were invited to complete an online survey and respondents were asked about their awareness and use of, and willingness to recommend, methods; one individual per triallist group [UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC)-registered Clinical Trials Units (CTUs), Medical Research Council (MRC) UK Hubs for Trials Methodology Research and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) UK Research Design Services (RDS)] was invited to complete a survey; (3) production of a structured guidance document to aid the design of future trials - the draft guidance was developed utilising the results of the systematic review and surveys by the project steering and advisory groups. SETTING: Methodological review incorporating electronic searches, review of books and guidelines, two surveys of experts (membership of an international society and UK- and Ireland-based triallists) and development of guidance. PARTICIPANTS: The two surveys were sent out to membership of the SCT and UK- and Ireland-based triallists. INTERVENTIONS: The review focused on methods for specifying the target difference in a RCT. It was not restricted to any type of intervention or condition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Methods for specifying the target difference for a RCT were considered. RESULTS: The search identified 11,485 potentially relevant studies. In total, 1434 were selected for full-text assessment and 777 were included in the review. Seven methods to specify the target difference for a RCT were identified - anchor, distribution, health economic, opinion-seeking, pilot study, review of evidence base (RoEB) and standardised effect size (SES) - each having important variations in implementation. A total of 216 of the included studies used more than one method. A total of 180 (15\%) responses to the SCT survey were received, representing 13 countries. Awareness of methods ranged from 38\% (n =69) for the health economic method to 90\% (n =162) for the pilot study. Of the 61 surveys sent out to UK triallist groups, 34 (56\%) responses were received. Awareness ranged from 97\% (n =33) for the RoEB and pilot study methods to only 41\% (n =14) for the distribution method. Based on the most recent trial, all bar three groups (91\%, n =30) used a formal method. Guidance was developed on the use of each method and the reporting of the sample size calculation in a trial protocol and results paper. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need for greater use of formal methods to determine the target difference and better reporting of its specification. Raising the standard of RCT sample size calculations and the corresponding reporting of them would aid health professionals, patients, researchers and funders in judging the strength of the evidence and ensuring better use of scarce resources.

  abstract = {The need for efficient use of available resources in medical research has led to the increased appeal of clinical trial designs based on multiple responses, multiple treatment arms and repeated tests of significance. In recent years there has been considerable methodological work pertaining to these types of multiple comparison, with the common objective typically being the control of the experimental type I error rate. Here we reconsider the appropriateness of these objectives in a variety of contexts and suggest that multiple-comparison procedures are frequently adopted unnecessarily. In particular we argue that, provided that a select number of important well-defined clinical questions are specified at the design, there are situations in which multiple tests of significance can be performed without control of the experimental type I error rate. The primary restriction for this to be reasonable is that test results are interpreted marginally.},

Given that both IPD and AD are equally available, meta-analysis of IPD is superior to meta-analysis of AD. IPD meta-analysis permits synthesists to perform subgroup analyses not conducted by the original collectors of the data, to check the data and analyses in the original studies, to add new information to the data sets, and to use different statistical methods. However, the cost of IPD meta-analysis and the lack of available IPD data sets suggest that the best strategy currently available is to use both approaches in a complementary fashion such that the first step in conducting an IPD meta-analysis would be to conduct an AD meta-analysis. Regardless of whether a meta-analysis is conducted with IPD or AD, synthesists must remain vigilant in how they interpret their results. They must avoid ecological fallacies, Simpson's paradox, and interpretation of synthesis-generated evidence as supporting causal inferences.},

The book reflects updates to the original JARS and the MARS that meet researchers' developing needs in the behavioral, social, educational, and medical sciences. It analyzes examples from APA journals, offering readers easy-to-read advice for implementing these revised standards in their own writing while also conforming with the APA Style guidelines laid out in the sixth edition of the Publication Manual. New and expanded chapters offer more detailed guidelines for reporting statistical analyses and unique elements of different types of research, including replication studies, clinical trials, and observational studies. This book is essential reading for experienced and early career researchers alike, as well as undergraduate and graduate students in research methods classes. It presents what JARS recommends for information to include in all reports on new quantitative data collections, and addresses the material that appears first in a research manuscript. It also describes the Method section, presents the JARS standards for reporting basic research designs and covers the general reporting requirements for the statistical results of studies with multiple participants in each condition.

We explain the multiple-comparison problem and demonstrate that researchers almost never correct for it.

  abstract = {The reproduction and replication of research results has become a major issue for a number of scientific disciplines. In computer science and related computational disciplines such as systems biology, the challenges closely revolve around the ability to implement (and exploit) novel algorithms and models. Taking a new approach from the literature and applying it to a new codebase frequently requires local knowledge missing from the published manuscripts and transient project websites. Alongside this issue, benchmarking, and the lack of open, transparent and fair benchmark sets present another barrier to the verification and validation of claimed results.In this paper, we outline several recommendations to address these issues, driven by specific examples from a range of scientific domains. Based on these recommendations, we propose a high-level prototype open automated platform for scientific software development which effectively abstracts specific dependencies from the individual researcher and their workstation, allowing easy sharing and reproduction of results. This new e-infrastructure for reproducible computational science offers the potential to incentivise a culture change and drive the adoption of new techniques to improve the quality and efficiency -- and thus reproducibility -- of scientific exploration.},

  abstract = {One of the most used methods to examine sources of heterogeneity in meta-analyses is the so-called `subgroup analysis'. In a subgroup analysis, the included studies are divided into two or more subgroups, and it is tested whether the pooled effect sizes found in these subgroups differ significantly from each other. Subgroup analyses can be considered as a core component of most published meta-analyses. One important problem of subgroup analyses is the lack of statistical power to find significant differences between subgroups. In this paper, we explore the power problems of subgroup analyses in more detail, using `metapower', a recently developed statistical package in R to examine power in meta-analyses, including subgroup analyses. We show that subgroup analyses require many more included studies in a meta-analysis than are needed for the main analyses. We work out an example of an `average' meta-analysis, in which a subgroup analysis requires 3--4 times the number of studies that are needed for the main analysis to have sufficient power. This number of studies increases exponentially with decreasing effect sizes and when the studies are not evenly divided over the subgroups. Higher heterogeneity also requires increasing numbers of studies. We conclude that subgroup analyses remain an important method to examine potential sources of heterogeneity in meta-analyses, but that meta-analysts should keep in mind that power is very low for most subgroup analyses. As in any statistical evaluation, researchers should not rely on a test and p-value to interpret results, but should compare the confidence intervals and interpret results carefully.},

Because p values dominate statistical analysis in psychology, it is important to ask what p says about replication. The answer to this question is "Surprisingly little." In one simulation of 25 repetitions of a typical experiment, p varied from {$<$}.001 to .76, thus illustrating that p is a very unreliable measure. This article shows that, if an initial experiment results in two-tailed p = .05, there is an 80\% chance the one-tailed p value from a replication will fall in the interval (.00008, .44), a 10\% chance that p {$<$} .00008, and fully a 10\% chance that p {$>$} .44. Remarkably, the interval--termed a p interval--is this wide however large the sample size, p is so unreliable and gives such dramatically vague information that it is a poor basis for inference. Confidence intervals, however, give much better information about replication. Researchers should minimize the role of p by using confidence intervals and modelfitting techniques and by adopting meta-analytic thinking.}

It is chock full of practical examples and tips on how to analyze and report research results using these techniques. The book is invaluable to readers interested in meeting the new APA Publication Manual guidelines by adopting the new statistics - which are more informative than null hypothesis significance testing, and becoming widely used in many disciplines. Accompanying the book is the Exploratory Software for Confidence Intervals (ESCI) package, free software that runs under Excel and is accessible at www.thenewstatistics.com. The book's exercises use ESCI's simulations, which are highly visual and interactive, to engage users and encourage exploration. Working with the simulations strengthens understanding of key statistical ideas. There are also many examples, and detailed guidance to show readers how to analyze their own data using the new statistics, and practical strategies for interpreting the results. A particular strength of the book is its explanation of meta-analysis, using simple diagrams and examples. Understanding meta-analysis is increasingly important, even at undergraduate levels, because medicine, psychology and many other disciplines now use meta-analysis to assemble the evidence needed for evidence-based practice. The book's pedagogical program, built on cognitive science principles, reinforces learning: Boxes provide "evidence-based" advice on the most effective statistical techniques.  Numerous examples reinforce learning, and show that many disciplines are using the new statistics. Graphs are tied in with ESCI to make important concepts vividly clear and memorable. Opening overviews and end of chapter take-home messages summarize key points. Exercises encourage exploration, deep understanding, and practical applications. This highly accessible book is intended as the core text for any course that emphasizes the new statistics, or as a supplementary text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate courses in statistics and research methods in departments of psychology, education, human development , nursing, and natural, social, and life sciences. Researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the new statistics, and future published research, will also appreciate this book.

In the first paper of a series of three, we explore two methods to pool continuous outcomes in a meta-analysis combining parallel and cross-over trial designs: the weighted mean difference (WMD) and the standardized weighted mean difference (SWMD). The combined design meta-analytic formulae are based on a weighted average of the two design treatment estimates. A random effects model can be implemented. Both WMD and SWMD can be used, the choice of the method is determined by the type of outcomes obtained in the trials. Compared to the number of included subjects, the relative weight of the cross-over design is large in combined-design meta-analysis. Differences in the weight estimation between WMD and SWMD can also accentuate the relative weight of cross-over trials, which must be considered a case of design-specific bias.},

When pooling treatment effects estimated from parallel trials and two-period two-treatment cross-over trials, meta-analytic estimators of treatment effect can be obtained from the combination of parallel trial results either with cross-over trial results based on data of the first period only or with cross-over trial results analysed with data from both periods. Taking data from the first cross-over period protects against carry-over but gives less efficient treatment estimators and may lead to selection bias. This study evaluates in terms of variance reduction and mean square error the cost of calculating meta-analysis estimates with data from the first period instead of data from the two cross-over periods. If the information on cross-over sequence is available, we recommend performing two combined design meta-analyses, one using the first cross-over period data and one based on data from both cross-over periods. To investigate simultaneously the statistical significance of these two estimators as well as the carry-over at meta-analysis level, a method based on a multivariate analysis of the meta-analytic treatment effect and carry-over estimates is proposed.},

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS: Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant with a novel mechanism of action; it increases noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission via  blockade of central {$\alpha$}2-adrenergic auto- and heteroreceptors. The increased  release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) stimulates serotonin 5-HT1  receptors because mirtazapine directly blocks 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. The  enhancement of both noradrenergic- and 5-HT1 receptor-mediated neurotransmission  is thought to be responsible for the antidepressant activity of mirtazapine. In  short term (5 to 6 weeks) clinical trials in patients with depression.  mirtazapine produces clinical improvements significantly superior to those of  placebo, similar to those of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) [amitriptyline,  clomipramine and doxepin] and possibly superior to those of trazodone. Short term  clinical tolerability data suggest that mirtazapine produces fewer  anticholinergic-, adrenergic- and serotonergic-related adverse events than TCAs.  In rare cases, mirtazapine, in common with many antidepressants, was associated  with potentially serious changes in haematological parameters (e.g.  agranulocytosis and neutropenia). The drug appears to be safe in overdose and  possesses a very low propensity for inducing seizures. Comparisons with other  classes of antidepressants are needed to determine the relative position of  mirtazapine in clinical practice. However, preliminary data indicate that  mirtazapine, with its novel mechanism of action, is a promising addition to  currently available options for the treatment of depression. PHARMACODYNAMIC  PROPERTIES: In vitro neurochemical studies have demonstrated that mirtazapine  blocks central {$\alpha$}2-adrenergic auto- and heteroreceptors, but has no effect on  noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake. The affinity of the drug was 10-fold  higher for central presynaptic {$\alpha$}2-adrenoceptors than for central postsynaptic and  peripheral {$\alpha$}2-adrenoceptors, and 30-fold higher for {$\alpha$}2-adrenoceptors than for  {$\alpha$}1-adrenoceptors. Microdialysis and neurophysiological experiments as well as  behavioural studies performed in rats support the {$\alpha$}2-adrenoceptor antagonist  properties of mirtazapine. Receptor binding studies have shown that mirtazapine  has a high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, central and  peripheral histamine H1 receptors and a low affinity for 5-HT1, dopaminergic and  muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Its activity at serotonin receptor subtypes has  been confirmed in animal behaviour models. Mirtazapine activates 5-HT1  receptor-mediated serotonergic neurotransmission by enhancing the stimulatory  effect of the noradrenergic system on serotonergic cell firing (an  {$\alpha$}1-adrenoceptor-mediated effect) as well as antagonising the inhibitory effect of  the noradrenergic system on serotonin release (an {$\alpha$}2-adrenoceptor-mediated  effect). Electrophysiological experiments have demonstrated that mirtazapine  enhances serotonergic transmission through blockade of presynaptic  {$\alpha$}2-adrenoceptors. The drug does not inhibit serotonin reuptake. PHARMACOKINETIC  PROPERTIES: The bioavailability of mirtazapine is approximately 50\%. Peak plasma  concentrations are reached within 2.2 to 3.1 hours after single oral doses of 15  to 75mg and are dose-dependent. Mirtazapine is extensively metabolised in the  liver; up to 85\% of the drug is eliminated in the urine (up to 4\% as unchanged  drug) and the remaining 15\% is eliminated in the faeces. The mean elimination  half-life of mirtazapine is approximately 22 hours, making it suitable for  once-daily administration. THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL: In randomised double-blind  comparative trials including patients with major depression, short term (5 to 6  weeks) therapy with mirtazapine was significantly more effective than placebo, as  effective as amitriptyline, clomipramine and doxepin, and at least as effective  as trazodone. Results from a meta-analysis of 5 comparative trials in which 60\%  of patients were hospitalised with severe depression [mean baseline 17-item  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score {$\geq$}25] revealed no significant  differences between mirtazapine and amitriptyline. The responder rates ({$\geq$}50\%  decrease in HAMD score from baseline) at 6 weeks and study end-point were 70 and  61 \%, respectively, for mirtazapine and 73 and 64\%, respectively, for  amitriptyline. In a comparative trial in older outpatients (mean age 61 to 63  years), reductions in rating scale scores of depression and the percentage of  responders tended to be higher in mirtazapine than in trazodone recipients.  TOLERABILITY: The tolerability profile of mirtazapine is based on results from  short term (5 to 6 weeks) comparisons with placebo and other antidepressants; no  longer term data are available. Drowsiness (23 vs 14\%), excessive sedation (19 vs  5\%), dry mouth (25 vs 16\%), increased appetite (11 vs 2\%) and bodyweight gain (10  vs 1\%) occurred significantly more frequently with mirtazapine in  placebo-controlled trials. Analysis of blood pressure, heart rate and symptoms of  sexual dysfunction indicated no significant differences between mirtazapine and  placebo recipients. In a meta-analysis, mirtazapine appeared to be better  tolerated than amitriptyline, with significantly fewer patients experiencing  anticholinergic (dry mouth, constipation, and abnormal accommodation and vision),  cardiac (palpitations and tachycardia) and neurological (tremor and vertigo)  adverse events. Mirtazapine was at least as well tolerated as clomipramine,  doxepin and trazodone in comparative trials and appeared to be associated with  slightly lower incidences of anticholinergic and neurological adverse events than  these drugs. Clinical trial and postmarketing surveillance data suggest that  mirtazapine has a very low potential for inducing seizures. Excessive but  transient somnolence was the only symptom noted in 10 patients taking an overdose  (up to 315mg) of mirtazapine. Mirtazapine is infrequently associated with  clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters. Granulocytopenia and  elevated alanine aminotransferase levels have been reported; most were mild in  severity and returned to normal values with continued administration of  mirtazapine. Elevated cholesterol levels (mean 3 to 4\%) have also been reported.  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: The recommended starting dosage of mirtazapine is 15  mg/day for 4 days, then 30 mg/day for 10 days. If effective, the drug should be  continued unchanged at this dosage or, in patients assessed as insufficiently  improved, the daily dosage may be further increased to 45 mg/day. In patients  with hepatic or renal insufficiency, careful dosage titration as well as regular  and close monitoring for adverse events is recommended. Concomitant use of  mirtazapine and diazepam or alcohol (ethanol) may also impair cognitive and/or  motor performance.},

  abstract = {Researchers commonly explore their data in multiple ways before deciding which analyses they will include in the final versions of their papers. While this improves the chances of researchers finding publishable results, it introduces an "opportunistic bias," such that the reported relations are stronger or otherwise more supportive of the researcher's theories than they would be without the exploratory process. The magnitudes of opportunistic biases can often be stronger than those of the effects being investigated, leading to invalid conclusions and a lack of clarity in research results. Authors typically do not report their exploratory procedures, so opportunistic biases are very difficult to detect just by reading the final version of a research report. In this article, we explain how a number of accepted research practices can lead to opportunistic biases, discuss the prevalence of these practices in psychology, consider the different effects that opportunistic biases have on psychological science, evaluate the strategies that methodologists have proposed to prevent or correct for the effects of these biases, and introduce an integrated solution to reduce the prevalence and influence of opportunistic biases. The recent prominence of articles discussing questionable research practices both in scientific journals and in the public media underscores the importance of understanding how opportunistic biases are created and how we might undo their effects.},

When comparing two independent groups, the most commonly used estimator of effect size is Cohen's ds where sample mean difference is divided by the pooled standard deviation. However, computing the pooled error term is not valid when both groups do not share common population variances. Furthermore, the assumption of equal population variances is unlikely in many psychological fields. Consequently, researchers shift to the use of Welch's t-test over Student's t-test in the context of hypothesis testing. Meanwhile, the question which effect size to report when equal variances are not assumed remains open. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we compare Hedges' gs (i.e. Cohen's ds with correction for bias) to Glass's gs, Shieh's gs and Hedges' g\_s{\textasciicircum}*. Comparisons are made under normality as well as under realistic deviations from the assumptions of normality and equal variances. Although it is not directly related with Welch's t-test (unlike Shieh's gs), we recommend the use of Hedges' g\_s{\textasciicircum}* because it shows better properties than all other estimators. Practical recommendations, R package and Shiny App in order to compute effect size estimators and confidence intervals are provided.},

  abstract = {Key points Previous studies have indicated that several weeks of strength training is sufficient to elicit significant adaptations in the neural drive sent to the muscles. There are few data, however, on the changes elicited by strength training in the recruitment and rate coding of motor units during voluntary contractions. We show for the first time that the discharge characteristics of motor units in the tibialis anterior muscle tracked across the intervention are changed by 4 weeks of strength training with isometric voluntary contractions. The specific adaptations included significant increases in motor unit discharge rate, decreases in the recruitment-threshold force of motor units and a similar input--output gain of the motor neurons. The findings suggest that the adaptations in motor unit function may be attributable to changes in synaptic input to the motor neuron pool or to adaptations in intrinsic motor neuron properties. Abstract The strength of a muscle typically begins to increase after only a few sessions of strength training. This increase is usually attributed to changes in the neural drive to muscle as a result of adaptations at the cortical or spinal level. We investigated the change in the discharge characteristics of large populations of longitudinally tracked motor units in tibialis anterior before and after 4 weeks of strength training the ankle-dorsiflexor muscles with isometric contractions. The adaptations exhibited by 14 individuals were compared with 14 control subjects. High-density electromyogram grids with 128 electrodes recorded the myoelectric activity during isometric ramp contractions to the target forces of 35\%, 50\% and 70\% of maximal voluntary force. The motor unit recruitment and derecruitment thresholds, discharge rate, interspike intervals and estimates of synaptic inputs to motor neurons were assessed. The normalized recruitment-threshold forces of the motor units were decreased after strength training (P {$<$} 0.05). Moreover, discharge rate increased by 3.3 {\textpm} 2.5 pps (average across subjects and motor units) during the plateau phase of the submaximal isometric contractions (P {$<$} 0.001). Discharge rates at recruitment and derecruitment were not modified by training (P {$<$} 0.05). The association between force and motor unit discharge rate during the ramp-phase of the contractions was also not altered by training (P {$<$} 0.05). These results demonstrate for the first time that the increase in muscle force after 4 weeks of strength training is the result of an increase in motor neuron output from the spinal cord to the muscle.},

This chapter argues that sample size issues are sometimes over-stressed at expense of others in clinical trials. The usual point of view is that the sample size is the determined function of variability, statistical method, power, and difference sought. A very unsatisfactory feature of conventional approaches to sample size calculation is that there is no mention of cost. The chapter discusses that there are various Bayesian suggestions. It considers an alternative frequentist approach to going beyond the P-value, that of severity, an approach championed by Deborah Mayo. P-values are a perfectly reasonable way for scientists to communicate the results of a significance test even if decisions rather than inferences are the object.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Although caffeine is one of the most commonly used substances in combat sports, information about its ergogenic effects on these disciplines is very limited. PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of ingesting a moderate dose of caffeine to enhance overall performance during a simulated Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) competition. METHODS: Fourteen elite BJJ athletes participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design. In a random order, the athletes ingested either 3 mg/kg body mass of caffeine or a placebo (cellulose, 0 mg/kg) and performed 2 simulated BJJ combats (with 20 min rest between them), following official BJJ rules. Specific physical tests such as maximal handgrip dynamometry, maximal height during a countermovement jump, permanence during a maximal static-lift test, peak power in a bench-press exercise, and blood lactate concentration were measured at 3 specific times: before the first combat and immediately after the first and second combats. The combats were video-recorded to analyze fight actions. RESULTS: After the caffeine ingestion, participants spent more time in offensive actions in both combats and revealed higher blood lactate values (P {$<$} .05). Performance in all physical tests carried out before the first combat was enhanced with caffeine (P {$<$} .05), and some improvements remained after the first combat (eg, maximal static-lift test and bench-press exercise; P {$<$} .05). After the second combat, the values in all physical tests were similar between caffeine and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine might be an effective ergogenic aid for improving intensity and physical performance during successive elite BJJ combats.},

  abstract = {Obtaining evidence that something does not exist requires knowing how big it would be were it to exist. Testing a theory that predicts an effect thus entails specifying the range of effect sizes consistent with the theory, in order to know when the evidence counts against the theory. Indeed, a theoretically relevant effect size must be specified for power calculations, equivalence testing, and Bayes factors in order that the inferential statistics test the theory. Specifying relevant effect sizes for power, or the equivalence region for equivalence testing, or the scale factor for Bayes factors, is necessary for many journal formats, such as registered reports, and should be necessary for all articles that use hypothesis testing. Yet there is little systematic advice on how to approach this problem. This article offers some principles and practical advice for specifying theoretically relevant effect sizes for hypothesis testing.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Muscle damage and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) can occur following intense exercise. Various modalities have been studied to improve blood lactate accumulation, which is a primary reason for DOMS. It has been well established that active recovery facilitates blood lactate removal more rapidly that passive recovery due to the pumping action of the muscle. The pedal pump is a manual lymphatic technique used in osteopathic manipulative medicine to increase lymphatic drainage throughout the body. Pedal pump has been shown to increase lymphatic flow and improve immunity. This may improve circulation and improve clearance of metabolites post-exercise. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the use of pedal pump lymphatic technique to passive supine recovery following maximal exercise. METHODS: 17 subjects (male n\,=\,10, age 23\,{\textpm}\,3.01; female n\,=\,7, age 24\,{\textpm}\,1.8), performed a maximal volume O2 test (VO2 max) using a Bruce protocol, followed by a recovery protocol using either pedal pump technique or supine passive rest for 10~min, followed by sitting for 10~min. Outcome measures included blood lactate concentration (BL), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and VO2. Subjects returned on another day to repeat the VO2 max test to perform the other recovery protocol. All outcomes were measured at rest, within 1- minute post-peak exercise, and at minutes 4, 7, 10 and 20 of the recovery protocols. A 2\,{\texttimes}\,6 repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare outcome measures (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.05). RESULTS: No significant differences were found in VO2, HR, or SBP between any of the recovery protocols. There was no significant difference in BL concentrations for recovery at minutes 4, 7, or 10 (p\,{$>$}\,0.05). However, the pedal pump recovery displayed significantly lower BL concentrations at minute 20 of recovery (p\,=\,0.04). CONCLUSION: The pedal pump significantly decreased blood lactate concentrations following intense exercise at recovery minute 20. The use of manual lymphatic techniques in exercise recovery should be investigated further.},

Thirty men (mean (SD): age 25 (3)~years; body mass, 80.9 (7.7)~kg) received a habitual diet (CON, n~=~15) or received a habitual diet plus an additional food supplement (SUP, n~=~15). From weeks 0--6, CON received 14.0~MJ~day-1 and SUP received 19.7~MJ~day-1, and during a final 2-week field exercise in weeks 7 and 8, CON received 17.7~MJ~day-1 and SUP received 21.3~MJ~day-1. Blood and saliva were taken at rest after an overnight fast at weeks 0, 6 and 8. Body mass loss over the 8 weeks was greater in CON (CON, 5.0 (2.3); SUP, 1.6 (1.5)~kg: P~{$<~$}0.001). Training-induced decreases in circulating total leucocytes (CON: weeks 0, 8.0 (2.1); weeks 8, 6.5 (1.6) 109~l-1, P~{$<~$}0.01), lymphocytes (21\%, P~{$<~$}0.01) and monocytes (20\%, P~{$<~$}0.01) were prevented by the nutritional supplement. Saliva SIgA secretion rate increased approximately twofold by week 8 in SUP (P~{$<~$}0.01) and was greater at week 8 compared with CON (P~{$<~$}0.01). Circulating neutrophils, bacterially stimulated neutrophil degranulation, IL-6 and cortisol were similar in CON and SUP at week 8. In conclusion, a daily mixed nutritional supplement prevented the decrease in circulating total leucocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes and increased saliva SIgA output during an 8-week arduous training programme. The increase in saliva SIgA with nutritional supplementation during training may reduce susceptibility to upper respiratory infection.},

  abstract = {Quantitative exploratory research implies a flexible examination of a dataset with the purpose of finding patterns, associations, and interactions between variables to help formulate a hypothesis, which should be severely tested in a future confirmatory study. In many fields, including sport and exercise science, exploratory research is not openly reported, a practice that leads to serious problems. At the same time, exploration is a crucial step in scientific knowledge generation, and a substantial proportion of studies will be exploratory in nature, or include both confirmatory and exploratory analyses. Using a flowchart, we review how data are typically collected and used, and we distinguish exploratory from confirmatory studies by arguing that data-driven analyses, where the Type I and Type II error cannot be controlled, is what characterises exploratory research. We ask which factors increase the quality and value of exploratory analyses, and highlight large sample sizes, uncommon sample compositions, rigorous data collection, widely used measures, observing a logical and coherent pattern across multiple variables, and the potential for generating new research questions as the main factors. Finally, we provide guidelines for carrying out and transparently writing up an exploratory study.},

The tutorial reviews key concepts in multiple hypothesis testing and introduces main classes of methods for addressing multiplicity in a clinical trial setting. General guidelines for the development of relevant and efficient multiple testing procedures are presented on the basis of application-specific clinical and statistical information. Case studies with common multiplicity problems are used to motivate and illustrate the statistical methods presented in the tutorial, and software implementation of the multiplicity adjustment methods is discussed.

For example, what does it mean if a replication attempt ``fails''---does it mean that the original results, or the theory that predicted them, have been falsified? And how should ``failed'' replications affect our belief in the validity of the original research? In this paper, we consider the replication debate from a historical and philosophical perspective, and provide a conceptual analysis of both replication and falsification as they pertain to this important discussion. Along the way, we highlight the importance of auxiliary assumptions (for both testing theories and attempting replications), and introduce a Bayesian framework for assessing ``failed'' replications in terms of how they should affect our confidence in original findings.},

As of May, 1990, 285 of the studies had been analysed by the investigators, and 52\% of these had been published. Studies with statistically significant results were more likely to be published than those finding no difference between the study groups (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2{$\cdot$}32; 95\% confidence interval [Cl] 1{$\cdot$}25-4{$\cdot$}28). Studies with significant results were also more likely to lead to a greater number of publications and presentations and to be published in journals with a high citation impact factor. An increased likelihood of publication was also associated with a high rating by the investigator of the importance of the study results, and with increasing sample size. The tendency towards publication bias was greater with observational and laboratory-based experimental studies (OR=3{$\cdot$}79; 95\% CI=1{$\cdot$}47-9{$\cdot$}76) than with randomised clinical trials (OR=0{$\cdot$}84; 95\% CI=0{$\cdot$}34-2{$\cdot$}09). We have confirmed the presence of publication bias in a cohort of clinical research studies. These findings suggest that conclusions based only on a review of published data should be interpreted cautiously, especially for observational studies. Improved strategies are needed to identify the results of unpublished as well as published studies.},

Weak time of semester effects were observed on data quality indicators, participant sex, and a few individual differences---conscientiousness, mood, and stress. However, there was little evidence for time of semester qualifying experimental or correlational effects. The generality of this evidence is unknown because only a subset of the tested effects demonstrated evidence for the original result in the whole sample.

  abstract = {Replication studies in psychological science sometimes fail to reproduce prior findings. If these studies use methods that are unfaithful to the original study or ineffective in eliciting the phenomenon of interest, then a failure to replicate may be a failure of the protocol rather than a challenge to the original finding. Formal pre-data-collection peer review by experts may address shortcomings and increase replicability rates. We selected 10 replication studies from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (RP:P; Open Science Collaboration, 2015) for which the original authors had expressed concerns about the replication designs before data collection; only one of these studies had yielded a statistically significant effect (p {$<$} .05). Commenters suggested that lack of adherence to expert review and low-powered tests were the reasons that most of these RP:P studies failed to replicate the original effects. We revised the replication protocols and received formal peer review prior to conducting new replication studies. We administered the RP:P and revised protocols in multiple laboratories (median number of laboratories per original study = 6.5, range = 3--9; median total sample = 1,279.5, range = 276--3,512) for high-powered tests of each original finding with both protocols. Overall, following the preregistered analysis plan, we found that the revised protocols produced effect sizes similar to those of the RP:P protocols ({$\Delta$}r = .002 or .014, depending on analytic approach). The median effect size for the revised protocols (r = .05) was similar to that of the RP:P protocols (r = .04) and the original RP:P replications (r = .11), and smaller than that of the original studies (r = .37). Analysis of the cumulative evidence across the original studies and the corresponding three replication attempts provided very precise estimates of the 10 tested effects and indicated that their effect sizes (median r = .07, range = .00--.15) were 78\% smaller, on average, than the original effect sizes (median r = .37, range = .19--.50).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

People in organizations confront multiple situational requirements, develop multiple and often conflicting goals, and respond with communicative strategies which do not always minimize ambiguity, but are nonetheless effective. Strategic ambiguity is essential to organizing in that it: (1) promotes unified diversity, (2) facilitates organizational change, and (3) amplifies existing source attributions and preserves privileged positions.}

  abstract = {Despite flourishing interest in the topic of fatigue-as indicated by the many presentations on fatigue at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine-surprisingly little is known about its effect on human performance. There are two main reasons for this dilemma: 1) the inability of current terminology to accommodate the scope of the conditions ascribed to fatigue, and 2) a paucity of validated experimental models. In contrast to current practice, a case is made for a unified definition of fatigue to facilitate its management in health and disease. On the basis of the classic two-domain concept of Mosso, fatigue is defined as a disabling symptom in which physical and cognitive function is limited by interactions between performance fatigability and perceived fatigability. As a symptom, fatigue can only be measured by self-report, quantified as either a trait characteristic or a state variable. One consequence of such a definition is that the word fatigue should not be preceded by an adjective (e.g., central, mental, muscle, peripheral, and supraspinal) to suggest the locus of the changes responsible for an observed level of fatigue. Rather, mechanistic studies should be performed with validated experimental models to identify the changes responsible for the reported fatigue. As indicated by three examples (walking endurance in old adults, time trials by endurance athletes, and fatigue in persons with multiple sclerosis) discussed in the review, however, it has proven challenging to develop valid experimental models of fatigue. The proposed framework provides a foundation to address the many gaps in knowledge of how laboratory measures of fatigue and fatigability affect real-world performance.},

The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68\% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were extremely or very helpful for 41\% of experiments, they were minimally helpful for 9\% of experiments, and not at all helpful (or did not respond to us) for 32\% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67\% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41\% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication - it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.},

  abstract = {Replicability is an important feature of scientific research, but aspects of contemporary research culture, such as an emphasis on novelty, can make replicability seem less important than it should be. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology was set up to provide evidence about the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology by repeating selected experiments from high-impact papers. A total of 50 experiments from 23 papers were repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of 158 effects. Most of the original effects were positive effects (136), with the rest being null effects (22). A majority of the original effect sizes were reported as numerical values (117), with the rest being reported as representative images (41). We employed seven methods to assess replicability, and some of these methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One method compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median effect size in the replications was 85\% smaller than the median effect size in the original experiments, and 92\% of replication effect sizes were smaller than the original. The other methods were binary -- the replication was either a success or a failure -- and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical values. For positive effects, 40\% of replications (39/97) succeeded according to three or more of these five methods, and for null effects 80\% of replications (12/15) were successful on this basis; combining positive and null effects, the success rate was 46\% (51/112). A successful replication does not definitively confirm an original finding or its theoretical interpretation. Equally, a failure to replicate does not disconfirm a finding, but it does suggest that additional investigation is needed to establish its reliability.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We have a weak understanding of how aerobic training may influence migraine, and the optimal parameters for exercise regimens as migraine therapy are not clear. The objectives of this study were to assess, first, effects of two different intensities of aerobic exercise on migraine headache indices; second, serum neuro-biomarker in women migraineurs. METHODS: A total of 45 non-athlete female migraine patients were selected by a neurologist and randomly divided into three groups: control (CON), moderate-intensity aerobic training (MOD T), and high-intensity aerobic training (HIGH T). Before and after the training protocol, body composition factors, migraine pain indices, VO2max, and serum Adenylate-Cyclase Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) and Substance P (SP) were measured. Exercise training protocol includes two different intensities of aerobic exercise: Moderate (13-15 Borg Scale, 60-80\% HRmax) and High (15-17 Borg Scale, 65-95\% HRmax). RESULTS: Moderate-intensity aerobic training (MOD T) reduced headache intensity, frequency, and duration in women with migraine (p\,{$<$}\,0.001, for all). Also, high-intensity aerobic training (HIGH T) reduced headache intensity, frequency, and duration (p\,{$<$}\,0.001, for all). However, for headache intensity and duration, MOD T was effective rather than HIGH T (p\,{$<$}\,0.001; p\,{$\leq$}\,0.05, respectively). In addition, neither MOD T nor HIGH T could not alter PACAP and SP contents (p\,=\,0.712; p\,=\,0.249, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that either MOD T or HIGH T could modify migraine pain indices but neither MOD T nor HIGH T could not alter the PACAP and SP contents in women with migraine.},

However, casual inspection of race split times and observational studies both indicate that elite triathletes competing in Olympic-distance triathlon typically implement a positive pacing strategy during the last of the 3 disciplines, the 10-km run. To address this apparent contradiction, the authors examined data from 14 International Triathlon Union elite races over 3 consecutive years involving a total of 725 male athletes. Analyses of race results confirm that triathletes typically implement a positive running pace strategy, running the first lap of the standard 4-lap circuit substantially faster than laps 2 ({$\sim$}7\%), 3 ({$\sim$}9\%), and 4 ({$\sim$}12\%). Interestingly, mean running pace in lap 1 had a substantially lower correlation with 10-km run time (r\,=\,.82) than both laps 2 and 3. Overall triathlon race performance (ranking) was best associated with run performance (r\,=\,.82) compared with the swim and cycle sections. Lower variability in race pace during the 10-km run was also reflective of more successful run times. Given that overall race outcome is mainly explained by the 10-km run performance, with top run performances associated with a more evenly paced strategy, triathletes (and their coaches) should reevaluate their pacing strategy during the run section.},

  abstract = {The application of currently available sophisticated algorithms of citation analysis allows for the incorporation of the ``quality'' of citations in the evaluation of scientific journals. We sought to compare the newly introduced SCImago journal rank (SJR) indicator with the journal impact factor (IF). We retrieved relevant information from the official Web sites hosting the above indices and their source databases. The SJR indicator is an open-access resource, while the journal IF requires paid subscription. The SJR indicator (based on Scopus data) lists considerably more journal titles published in a wider variety of countries and languages, than the journal IF (based on Web of Science data). Both indices divide citations to a journal by articles of the journal, during a specific time period. However, contrary to the journal IF, the SJR indicator attributes different weight to citations depending on the ``prestige'' of the citing journal without the influence of journal self-citations; prestige is estimated with the application of the PageRank algorithm in the network of journals. In addition, the SJR indicator includes the total number of documents of a journal in the denominator of the relevant calculation, whereas the journal IF includes only ``citable'' articles (mainly original articles and reviews). A 3-yr period is analyzed in both indices but with the use of different approaches. Regarding the top 100 journals in the 2006 journal IF ranking order, the median absolute change in their ranking position with the use of the SJR indicator is 32 (1st quartile: 12; 3rd quartile: 75). Although further validation is warranted, the novel SJR indicator poses as a serious alternative to the well-established journal IF, mainly due to its openaccess nature, larger source database, and assessment of the quality of citations.---Falagas, M.

Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, ``cooking'' of data, etc{\dots} Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N = 7, 95\%CI: 0.86--4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once --a serious form of misconduct by any standard-- and up to 33.7\% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N = 12, 95\% CI: 9.91--19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words ``falsification'' or ``fabrication'', and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others. Considering that these surveys ask sensitive questions and have other limitations, it appears likely that this is a conservative estimate of the true prevalence of scientific misconduct.},

Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have ``tested'' a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22\% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the ``hardness'' of scientific research---i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors---is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a ``positive'' (full or partial) or ``negative'' support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in ``softer'' sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

Growing concerns, in particular, are expressed for policies that reward ``quantity'' at the expense of ``quality,'' because these might prompt scientists to unduly multiply their publications by fractioning (``salami slicing''), duplicating, rushing, simplifying, or even fabricating their results. To assess the reasonableness of these concerns, we analyzed publication patterns of over 40,000 researchers that, between the years 1900 and 2013, have published two or more papers within 15 years, in any of the disciplines covered by the Web of Science. The total number of papers published by researchers during their early career period (first fifteen years) has increased in recent decades, but so has their average number of co-authors. If we take the latter factor into account, by measuring productivity fractionally or by only counting papers published as first author, we observe no increase in productivity throughout the century. Even after the 1980s, adjusted productivity has not increased for most disciplines and countries. These results are robust to methodological choices and are actually conservative with respect to the hypothesis that publication rates are growing. Therefore, the widespread belief that pressures to publish are causing the scientific literature to be flooded with salami-sliced, trivial, incomplete, duplicated, plagiarized and false results is likely to be incorrect or at least exaggerated.},

  abstract = {Scientific disciplines face concerns about replicability and statistical inference, and these concerns are also relevant in animal cognition research. This paper presents a first attempt to assess how researchers make and publish claims about animal physical cognition, and the statistical inferences they use to support them. We surveyed 116 published experiments from 63 papers on physical cognition, covering 43 different species. The most common tasks in our sample were trap-tube tasks (14 papers), other tool use tasks (13 papers), means-end understanding and string-pulling tasks (11 papers), object choice and object permanence tasks (9 papers) and access tasks (5 papers). This sample is not representative of the full scope of physical cognition research; however, it does provide data on the types of statistical design and publication decisions researchers have adopted. Across the 116 experiments, the median sample size was 7. Depending on the definitions we used, we estimated that between 44\% and 59\% of our sample of papers made positive claims about animals' physical cognitive abilities, between 24\% and 46\% made inconclusive claims, and between 10\% and 17\% made negative claims. Several failures of animals to pass physical cognition tasks were reported. Although our measures had low inter-observer reliability, these findings show that negative results can and have been published in the field. However, publication bias is still present, and consistent with this, we observed a drop in the frequency of p-values above .05. This suggests that some non-significant results have not been published. More promisingly, we found that researchers are likely making many correct statistical inferences at the individual-level. The strength of evidence of statistical effects at the group-level was weaker, and its p-value distribution was consistent with some effect sizes being overestimated. Studies such as ours can form part of a wider investigation into statistical reliability in comparative cognition. However, future work should focus on developing the validity and reliability of the measurements they use, and we offer some starting points.},

Results show that no method works well across all conditions and that performance depends mainly on the population effect size value and the total variance.},

It is, however, important to conduct QRP studies with the same scrutiny as all research. We note problems with overestimates of QRP prevalence and the survey methods used in the frequently cited study by John, Loewenstein, and Prelec. In a survey of German psychologists, we decomposed QRP prevalence into its two multiplicative components, proportion of scientists who ever committed a behavior and, if so, how frequently they repeated this behavior across all their research. The resulting prevalence estimates are lower by order of magnitudes. We conclude that inflated prevalence estimates, due to problematic interpretation of survey data, can create a descriptive norm (QRP is normal) that can counteract the injunctive norm to minimize QRPs and unwantedly damage the image of behavioral sciences, which are essential to dealing with many societal problems.},

This discussion has led to changes in psychology's approach to research, and several new initiatives have been developed, many with the aim of improving our findings. One key advancement is the marked increase in the number of replication studies conducted. We argue that while it is important to conduct replications as part of regular research protocol, it is neither efficient nor useful to replicate results at random. We recommend adopting a methodical approach toward the selection of replication targets to maximize the impact of the outcomes of those replications, and minimize waste of scarce resources. In the current study, we demonstrate how a Bayesian re--analysis of existing research findings followed by a simple qualitative assessment process can drive the selection of the best candidate article for replication.},

It is unknown how the frequency and transparency of the reported changes depend on reporting method and whether the PEP changes are associated with trial positivity (ie, the trial met the prespecified statistical threshold for PEP positivity).To assess the frequency of reported PEP changes in oncology randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and whether these changes are associated with trial positivity.This cross-sectional study used publicly available data for complete oncology phase 3 RCTs registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from inception through February 2020.The main outcome was change between the initial PEP and the final reported PEP, assessed using 3 methods: (1) history of tracked changes on ClinicalTrials.gov, (2) self-reported changes noted in the article, and (3) changes reported within the protocol, including all available protocol documents. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate whether PEP changes were associated with US Food and Drug Administration approval or trial positivity.Of 755 included trials, 145 (19.2\%) had PEP changes found by at least 1 of the 3 detection methods. Of the 145 trials with PEP changes, 102 (70.3\%) did not have PEP changes disclosed within the manuscript. There was significant variability in rates of PEP detection by each method ({$\chi$}2\,=\,72.1; P\,\&lt;\,.001). Across all methods, PEP changes were detected at higher rates when multiple versions of the protocol (47 of 148 [31.8\%]) were available compared with 1 version (22 of 134 [16.4\%]) or no protocol (76 of 473 [16.1\%]) ({$\chi$}2\,=\,18.7; P\,\&lt;\,.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that PEP changes were associated with trial positivity (odds ratio, 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.25-2.82; P\,=\,.003).This cross-sectional study revealed substantial rates of PEP changes among active RCTs; PEP changes were markedly underreported in published articles and mostly occurred after reported study completion dates. Significant discrepancies in the rate of detected PEP changes call into question the role of increased protocol transparency and completeness in identifying key changes occurring in active trials.}

Although often discussed separately, these five challenges may share a common cause: insufficient investment of intellectual and nonintellectual resources into the typical psychology study. We suggest that the emerging emphasis on big-team science can help address these challenges by allowing researchers to pool their resources together to increase the amount available for a single study. However, the current incentives, infrastructure, and institutions in academic science have all developed under the assumption that science is conducted by solo principal investigators and their dependent trainees, an assumption that creates barriers to sustainable big-team science. We also anticipate that big-team science carries unique risks, such as the potential for big-team-science organizations to be co-opted by unaccountable leaders, become overly conservative, and make mistakes at a grand scale. Big-team-science organizations must also acquire personnel who are properly compensated and have clear roles. Not doing so raises risks related to mismanagement and a lack of financial sustainability. If researchers can manage its unique barriers and risks, big-team science has the potential to spur great progress in psychology and beyond.},

The authors show that the average sample size in social-personality research is 104 and that the power to detect the typical effect size in the field is approximately 50\%. Moreover, they show that there is considerable variation among journals in sample sizes and power of the studies they publish, with some journals consistently publishing higher power studies than others. The authors hope that these rankings will be of use to authors who are choosing where to submit their best work, provide hiring and promotion committees with a superior way of quantifying journal quality, and encourage competition among journals to improve their NF rankings.},

  abstract = {Replication of empirical findings plays a fundamental role in science. Among experimental psychologists, successful replication enhances belief in a finding, while a failure to replicate is often interpreted to mean that one of the experiments is flawed. This view is wrong. Because experimental psychology uses statistics, empirical findings should appear with predictable probabilities. In a misguided effort to demonstrate successful replication of empirical findings and avoid failures to replicate, experimental psychologists sometimes report too many positive results. Rather than strengthen confidence in an effect, too much successful replication actually indicates publication bias, which invalidates entire sets of experimental findings. Researchers cannot judge the validity of a set of biased experiments because the experiment set may consist entirely of type I errors. This article shows how an investigation of the effect sizes from reported experiments can test for publication bias by looking for too much successful replication. Simulated experiments demonstrate that the publication bias test is able to discriminate biased experiment sets from unbiased experiment sets, but it is conservative about reporting bias. The test is then applied to several studies of prominent phenomena that highlight how publication bias contaminates some findings in experimental psychology. Additional simulated experiments demonstrate that using Bayesian methods of data analysis can reduce (and in some cases, eliminate) the occurrence of publication bias. Such methods should be part of a systematic process to remove publication bias from experimental psychology and reinstate the important role of replication as a final arbiter of scientific findings.},

Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.},

Null hypothesis testing also is insufficient for determining beliefs, but it is ideal for demonstrating sufficient evidential strength to support an ordinal claim, with sufficient evidence being 1 criterion for a finding entering the corpus of legitimate findings in psychology. The line between sufficient and insufficient evidence is currently set at p {$<$}.05; there is little reason for allowing experimenters to select their own value of alpha.

  abstract = {Science depends on trustworthy evidence. Thus, a biased scientific record is of questionable value because it impedes scientific progress, and the public receives advice on the basis of unreliable evidence that has the potential to have far-reaching detrimental consequences. Meta-analysis is a technique that can be used to summarize research evidence. However, meta-analytic effect size estimates may themselves be biased, threatening the validity and usefulness of meta-analyses to promote scientific progress. Here, we offer a large-scale simulation study to elucidate how p-hacking and publication bias distort meta-analytic effect size estimates under a broad array of circumstances that reflect the reality that exists across a variety of research areas. The results revealed that, first, very high levels of publication bias can severely distort the cumulative evidence. Second, p-hacking and publication bias interact: At relatively high and low levels of publication bias, p-hacking does comparatively little harm, but at medium levels of publication bias, p-hacking can considerably contribute to bias, especially when the true effects are very small or are approaching zero. Third, p-hacking can severely increase the rate of false positives. A key implication is that, in addition to preventing p-hacking, policies in research institutions, funding agencies, and scientific journals need to make the prevention of publication bias a top priority to ensure a trustworthy base of evidence.

Estimates of effect size are useful for determining the practical or theoretical importance of an effect, the relative contributions of factors, and the power of an analysis. We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial {$\eta$}2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis.}

In addition to statistical validation of an intervention in the context of experimental and quasi-experimental designs for hypothesis testing, the practical relevance of an intervention plays a major role. Practical relevance is considered a measure of an experimental effect with respect to various practical issues. Cohen's effect size has become the standard for assessment. However, empirical studies show that effect sizes should not be interpreted statically, but rather dynamically. Furthermore, it seems that prior experience, the target group, the way questions are posed and the context of the study influence the outcome. In the future, in addition to statistical validation, greater consideration should be given to effect sizes to allow a qualitative assessment of a measure's practical relevance. However, the applicable study context and theoretical criteria of the respective research domains must be taken into account. Key Words: statistical validation, practical relevance, effect size, strength training.},

  abstract = {Effect sizes are underappreciated and often misinterpreted---the most common mistakes being to describe them in ways that are uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of .05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of .10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of .20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size r of .30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size (r = .40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our goal is to help advance the treatment of effect sizes so that rather than being numbers that are ignored, reported without interpretation, or interpreted superficially or incorrectly, they become aspects of research reports that can better inform the application and theoretical development of psychological research.},

Given current concerns regarding research standards, we were interested in how Spanish scholars perceived COVID-19 research and the extent to which questionable research practices and potentially problematic academic incentives are commonplace. We asked researchers to evaluate~the expected quality of their COVID-19 projects and other peers' research and compared these assessments with those from scholars not involved in COVID-19 research. We investigated self-admitting and estimated rates of questionable research practices and attitudes towards current research status. Responses from 131 researchers suggested that COVID-19 evaluations followed partisan lines, with scholars~being more pessimistic~about others' colleagues' research~than their own. Additionally,researchers~not involved in COVID-19 projects were more negative~than~their participating peers. These differences were particularly notable for areas such as the expected theoretical foundations or overall quality of the research, among others. Most Spanish scholars expected questionable research practices and inadequate incentives to be widespread. In these two aspects, researchers tended to agree regardless of their involvement in COVID-19 research. We provide specific recommendations for improving future meta-science studies, such as redefining QRPs as inadequate research practices (IRP). This change could help avoid key controversies regarding QRPs' definition while highlighting their detrimental impact. Lastly, we join previous calls to improve transparency and academic career incentives as a cornerstone for generating trust in science.},

This new policy has been interpreted by some as a call to compare males and females with each other. Researchers testing for sex differences may not be trained to do so, however, increasing risk for misinterpretation of results. Using a list of recently published articles curated by Woitowich et al. (eLife, 2020; 9:e56344), we examined reports of sex differences and non-differences across nine biological disciplines. Sex differences were claimed in the majority of the 147 articles we analyzed; however, statistical evidence supporting those differences was often missing. For example, when a sex-specific effect of a manipulation was claimed, authors usually had not tested statistically whether females and males responded differently. Thus, sex-specific effects may be over-reported. In contrast, we also encountered practices that could mask sex differences, such as pooling the sexes without first testing for a difference. Our findings support the need for continuing efforts to train researchers how to test for and report sex differences in order to promote rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research., Biomedical research has a long history of including only men or male laboratory animals in studies. To address this disparity, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) rolled out a policy in 2016 called Sex as a Biological Variable (or SABV). The policy requires researchers funded by the NIH to include males and females in every experiment unless there is a strong justification not to, such as studies of ovarian cancer. Since then, the number of research papers including both sexes has continued to grow., Although the NIH does not require investigators to compare males and females, many researchers have interpreted the SABV policy as a call to do so. This has led to reports of sex differences that would otherwise have been unrecognized or ignored. However, researchers may not be trained on how best to test for sex differences in their data, and if the data are not analyzed appropriately this may lead to misleading interpretations., Here, Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney have examined the methods of 147 papers published in 2019 that included both males and females. They discovered that more than half of these studies had reported sex differences, but these claims were not always backed by statistical evidence. Indeed, in a large majority (more than 70\%) of the papers describing differences in how males and females responded to a treatment, the impact of the treatment was not actually statistically compared between the sexes. This suggests that sex-specific effects may be over-reported. In contrast, Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney also encountered instances where an effect may have been masked due to data from males and females being pooled together without testing for a difference first., These findings reveal how easy it is to draw misleading conclusions from sex-based data. Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney hope their work raises awareness of this issue and encourages the development of more training materials for researchers.},

Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary---for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1\% significance level to 4.9\%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems---that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not significant'' is not itself statistically significant.},

In this meta-analysis, we unite these research fields to facilitate a greater exchange between the two, to summarize the extant literature and to highlight open questions. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the effect of ego-depletion and mental fatigue on subsequent physical endurance performance (42 independent effect sizes). We found that ego-depletion or mental fatigue leads to a reduction in subsequent physical endurance performance (ES = -0.506 [95\% CI: -0.649, -0.369]) and that the duration of prior mental effort exertion did not predict the magnitude of subsequent performance impairment (r = -0.043). Further, analyses revealed that effects of prior mental exertion are more pronounced in subsequent tasks that use isolation tasks (e.g., handgrip; ES = -0.719 [-0.946, -0.493]) compared to whole-body endurance tasks (e.g. cycling; coefficient\,=\,0.338 [0.057, 0.621]) and that the observed reduction in performance is higher when the person-situation fit is low (ES for high person-situation fit = -0.355 [-0.529, -0.181], coefficient for low person-situation fit = -0.336 [-0.599, -0.073]). Taken together, the aggregate of the published literature on ego depletion or mental fatigue indicates that prior mental exertion is detrimental to subsequent physical endurance performance. However, this analysis also highlights several open questions regarding the effects' mechanisms and moderators. Particularly, the surprising finding that the duration of prior mental exertion seems to be unrelated to subsequent performance impairment needs to be addressed systematically.},

With age, NO production decreases and augmented NO production may provide beneficial effects on sports performance among masters athletes (MAs). PURPOSE: To examine the effects of acute CM supplementation on grip strength, vertical power, and anaerobic cycling performance in female, MA tennis players. METHODS: Seventeen female MA (51\,{\textpm}\,9 years) completed two double-blind, randomized trials consuming CM (12\>g dextrose\,+\,8\>g CM) and placebo (PLA) (12\>g dextrose). One hour after consumption, subjects completed grip strength, vertical power, and Wingate anaerobic cycling assessments in respective order. Maximal and average grip strength, peak and average vertical power, anaerobic capacity, peak power, explosive power, and ability to sustain anaerobic power were calculated from the tests. RESULTS: When consuming CM, participants exhibited greater maximal (p\,=\,.042) and average (p\,=\,.045) grip strength compared to PLA. No differences existed between trials for peak (p\,=\,.51) or average (p\,=\,.51) vertical power. For the Wingate, peak power (p\,{$<$}\,.001) and explosive power (p\,{$<$}\,.001) were significantly greater when consuming CM compared to PLA. For the ability to sustain power, a significant effect (p\,{$<$}\,.001) was observed for time within trials, but no significant differences were observed between trials regarding supplement consumed. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that consuming CM before competition has the potential to improve tennis match-play performance in masters tennis athletes. However, this study utilized a controlled laboratory environment and research evaluating direct application to on-court performance is warranted.},

  abstract = {According to Karl Popper, we can tell good theories from poor ones by assessing their empirical content (empirischer Gehalt), which basically reflects how much information they convey concerning the world. ``The empirical content of a statement increases with its degree of falsifiability: the more a statement forbids, the more it says about the world of experience.'' Two criteria to evaluate the empirical content of a theory are their level of universality (Allgemeinheit) and their degree of precision (Bestimmtheit). The former specifies how many situations it can be applied to. The latter refers to the specificity in prediction, that is, how many subclasses of realizations it allows. We conduct an analysis of the empirical content of theories in Judgment and Decision Making (JDM) and identify the challenges in theory formulation for different classes of models. Elaborating on classic Popperian ideas, we suggest some guidelines for publication of theoretical work.},

We propose that likelihood ratios are a more straightforward alternative to this approach. Likelihood ratios provide a measure of the fit of two competing models; the statistic represents a direct comparison of the relative likelihood of the data, given the best fit of the two models. Likelihood ratios offer an intuitive, easily interpretable statistic that allows the researcher great flexibility in framing empirical arguments. In support of this position, we report the results of a survey of empirical articles in psychology, in which the common uses of statistics by empirical psychologists is examined. From the results of this survey, we show that likelihood ratios are able to serve all the important statistical needs of researchers in empirical psychology in a format that is more straightforward and easier to interpret than traditional inferential statistics.},

In this note, we argue that the case of three-groups is special: with three groups, closed testing procedures are powerful and easy to use. We describe four different closed testing procedures specifically for the three-group set-up. The choice of method should be determined by assessing which of the comparisons are considered primary and which are secondary, as dictated by subject-matter considerations. We describe how all four methods can be used with any standard software.},

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

The p value was meant to be a flexible inferential measure, whereas the hypothesis test was a rule for behavior, not inference. The combination of the two methods has led to a reinterpretation of the p value simultaneously as an "observed error rate" and as a measure of evidence. Both of these interpretations are problematic, and their combination has obscured the important differences between Neyman and Fisher on the nature of the scientific method and inhibited our understanding of the philosophic implications of the basic methods in use today. An analysis using another method promoted by Fisher, mathematical likelihood, shows that the p value substantially overstates the evidence against the null hypothesis. Likelihood makes clearer the distinction between error rates and inferential evidence and is a quantitative tool for expressing evidential strength that is more appropriate for the purposes of epidemiology than the p value.},

The National Survey on Research Integrity targeted all disciplinary fields and academic ranks in the Netherlands. It included questions about engagement in fabrication, falsification and 11 QRPs over the previous three years, and 12 explanatory factor scales. We ensured strict identity protection and used the randomized response method for questions on research misconduct. 6,813 respondents completed the survey. Prevalence of fabrication was 4.3\% (95\% CI: 2.9, 5.7) and of falsification 4.2\% (95\% CI: 2.8, 5.6). Prevalence of QRPs ranged from 0.6\% (95\% CI: 0.5, 0.9) to 17.5\% (95\% CI: 16.4, 18.7) with 51.3\% (95\% CI: 50.1, 52.5) of respondents engaging frequently in at least one QRP. Being a PhD candidate or junior researcher increased the odds of frequently engaging in at least one QRP, as did being male. Scientific norm subscription (odds ratio (OR) 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.63, 1.00) and perceived likelihood of detection by reviewers (OR 0.62, 95\% CI: 0.44, 0.88) were associated with engaging in less research misconduct. Publication pressure was associated with more often engaging in one or more QRPs frequently (OR 1.22, 95\% CI: 1.14, 1.30). We found higher prevalence of misconduct than earlier surveys. Our results suggest that greater emphasis on scientific norm subscription, strengthening reviewers in their role as gatekeepers of research quality and curbing the ``publish or perish'' incentive system promotes research integrity.},

HRV was measured at rest and after participants completed a repeated sprint cycling test (10 {\texttimes} 6 s maximal sprints). Measurements were conducted before and after supplementation in the follicular/low hormone and luteal/high hormone phases. Creatine monohydrate supplementation did not influence HRV values, as no significant differences were seen in HRV values at rest or postexercise. For repeated sprint outcomes, there was a significant phase {\texttimes} supplement interaction (p = 0.048) for fatigue index, with the greatest improvement seen in high hormone in the creatine monohydrate group (-5.8 {\textpm} 19.0\%) compared to changes in the PL group (0.1 {\textpm} 8.1\%). Sprint performance and recovery were reduced by the high hormone for both groups. Though not statistically significant, the data suggests that creatine monohydrate could help counteract performance decrements caused by the high hormone. This data can help inform creatine monohydrate loading strategies for females, demonstrating potential benefits in the high hormone phase.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

Building on this, we highlight the dangers of a publication culture that continues to demand large effects. First, it rewards inflated effects that are unlikely to be real and encourages practices likely to yield such effects. Second, it overlooks the small effects that are most likely to be real, hindering attempts to identify and understand the actual determinants of complex psychological phenomena. We then explain the theoretical and practical relevance of small effects, which can have substantial consequences, especially when considered at scale and over time. Finally, we suggest ways in which scholars can harness these insights to advance research and practices in psychology (i.e., leveraging the power of big data, machine learning, and crowdsourcing science; promoting rigorous preregistration, including prespecifying the smallest effect size of interest; contextualizing effects; changing cultural norms to reward accurate and meaningful effects rather than exaggerated and unreliable effects). Only once small effects are accepted as the norm, rather than the exception, can a reliable and reproducible cumulative psychological science be built.},

The results of the method for estimating confidence intervals according to Steiger and Fouladi (1997) were not displayed correctly in the initially published paper (Figure 7 in Appendix C). The figure is corrected in the erratum. The new figure changes the interpretation of the method to a more favorable appreciation.] Effect sizes and confidence intervals are important statistics to assess the magnitude and the precision of an effect. The various standardized effect sizes can be grouped in three categories depending on the experimental design: measures of the difference between two means (the d family), measures of strength of association (e.g., r, R{$^2$}, {$\eta^2$}, {$\omega^2$}), and risk estimates (e.g., odds ratio, relative risk, phi; Kirk, 1996). Part I of this study reviews the d family, with a special focus on Cohen's d and Hedges' g for two-independent groups and two-repeated measures (or paired samples) designs. The present paper answers questions concerning the d family via Monte Carlo simulations. First, four different denominators are often proposed to standardize the mean difference in a repeated measures design. Which one should be used? Second, the literature proposes several approximations to estimate the standard error. Which one most closely estimates the true standard deviation of the distribution? Lastly, central and noncentral methods have been proposed to construct a confidence interval around d. Which method leads to more precise coverage, and how to calculate it? Results suggest that the best way to standardize the effect in both designs is by using the pooled standard deviation in conjunction with a correction factor to unbias d. Likewise, the best standard error approximation is given by substituting the gamma function from the true formula by its approximation. Lastly, results from the confidence interval simulations show that, under the normality assumption, the noncentral method is always superior, especially with small sample sizes. However, the central method is equivalent to the noncentral method when n is greater than 20 in each group for a between-group design and when n is greater than 24 pairs of observations for a repeated measures design. A practical guide to apply the findings of this study can be found after the general discussion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

We examined the impact of a 4-week period of n-3 FA supplementation during training on adaptations in 1RM knee extensor strength, 20-m sprint speed, vertical jump power, and anaerobic endurance capacity (Yo-Yo test) in competitive soccer players. Twenty six soccer players were randomly assigned to one of two groups: n-3 FA supplementation (n-3 FA; n = 13) or placebo (n = 13). Both groups performed two experimental trial days. Assessments of physical function and respiratory function were conducted pre (PRE) and post (POST) supplementation. Training session intensity, competitive games and nutritional intake were monitored during the 4-week period. No differences were observed in respiratory measurements (FEV1, FVC) between groups. No main effect of treatment was observed for 1RM knee extensor strength, explosive leg power, or 20 m sprint performance, but strength improved as a result of the training period in both groups (p {$<$} .05). Yo-Yo test distance improved with training in the n-3 FA group only (p {$<$} .01). The mean difference (95\% CI) in Yo-Yo test distance completed from PRE to POST was 203 (66-340) m for n-3 FA, and 62 (-94-217) m for placebo, with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d of 0.52). We conclude that 4 weeks of n-3 FA supplementation does not improve strength, power or speed assessments in competitive soccer players. However, the increase in anaerobic endurance capacity evident only in the n-3 FA treatment group suggests an interaction that requires further study.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

The input parameters for the model characterize investigators' probabilities of selecting a problem for which the null hypothesis is true, of reporting, following up on, or abandoning research when data do or do not reject the null hypothesis, and they characterize editors' probabilities of publishing manuscripts concluding in favor of or against the null hypothesis. With estimates of the input parameters based on a questionnaire survey of 75 social psychologists, the model output indicates a dysfunctional research-publication system. Particularly, the model indicates that there may be relatively few publications on problems for which the null hypothesis is (at least to a reasonable approximation) true, and of these, a high proportion will erroneously reject the null hypothesis. The case studies provide additional support for this conclusion. It is concluded that research traditions and customs of discrimination against accepting the null hypothesis may be very detrimental to research progress.

  abstract = {The positive effects of caffeine ingestion on aerobic performance are well-established; however, recent findings are suggesting that caffeine ingestion  might also enhance components of anaerobic performance. A commonly used test of  anaerobic performance and power output is the 30-second Wingate test. Several  studies explored the effects of caffeine ingestion on Wingate performance, with  equivocal findings. To elucidate this topic, this paper aims to determine the  effects of caffeine ingestion on Wingate performance using meta-analytic  statistical techniques. Following a search through PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and  SportDiscus({\textregistered}), 16 studies were found meeting the inclusion criteria (pooled  number of participants\,=\,246). Random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean  differences (SMD) for peak power output and mean power output was performed.  Study quality was assessed using the modified version of the PEDro checklist.  Results of the meta-analysis indicated a significant difference (p\,=\,.005)  between the placebo and caffeine trials on mean power output with SMD values of  small magnitude (0.18; 95\% confidence interval: 0.05, 0.31; +3\%). The  meta-analysis performed for peak power output indicated a significant difference  (p\,=\,.006) between the placebo and caffeine trials (SMD\,=\,0.27; 95\% confidence  interval: 0.08, 0.47 [moderate magnitude]; +4\%). The results from the PEDro  checklist indicated that, in general, studies are of good and excellent  methodological quality. This meta-analysis adds on to the current body of  evidence showing that caffeine ingestion can also enhance components of anaerobic  performance. The results presented herein may be helpful for developing more  efficient evidence-based recommendations regarding caffeine supplementation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the effects of beta-alanine supplementation on Yo-Yo test performance. METHODS: Nine databases  were searched to find relevant studies. A random-effects meta-analysis of  standardized mean differences (SMD) was performed for data analysis. Subgroup  meta-analyses were conducted to explore the effects of beta-alanine  supplementation duration on Yo-Yo test performance, and the effects of  beta-alanine supplementation on performance only in Yo-Yo level 2 test variants.  RESULTS: Ten study groups were included in the meta-analysis. All studies  included athletes as study participants. When considering all available studies,  there was no significant difference between the placebo/control and beta-alanine  groups (SMD: 0.68; 95\% confidence interval [CI]:~-0.30, 1.67). When considering  only the studies that used supplementation protocols lasting between 6 and 12  weeks, there was a significant ergogenic effect of beta-alanine (SMD: 1.02; 95\%  CI: 0.01, 2.05). When considering only the studies that used the level 2 variants  of the Yo-Yo test, there was a significant ergogenic effect of beta-alanine (SMD:  1.41; 95\% CI: 0.35, 2.48). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found that  beta-alanine is ergogenic for Yo-Yo test performance in athletes when the  supplementation protocol lasts between 6 and 12 weeks and when using the level 2  variants of the Yo-Yo test.},

Though impactful, meta-analyses fundamentally depend on the literature being sufficiently large to generate meaningful conclusions. Power analysis plays an important role in determining the number of studies required to conduct a substantive meta-analysis. Despite this, power analysis is rarely conducted or reported in published meta-analyses. A significant barrier to the widespread implementation of power analysis is the lack of available and accessible software for calculating statistical power for meta-analysis. In this paper, I provide an introduction to power analysis and present a practical tutorial for calculating statistical power using the R package metapower. The main functionality includes computing statistical power for summary effect sizes, tests of homogeneity, categorical moderator analysis, and subgroup analysis. This software is free, easy-to-use, and can be integrated into a continuous work flow with other meta-analysis packages in R.},

There is, however, concern that rewarding scientists chiefly on publication creates a perverse incentive, allowing careless and fraudulent conduct to thrive, compounded by the predisposition of top-tier journals towards novel, positive findings rather than investigations confirming null hypothesis. This potentially compounds a reproducibility crisis in several fields, and risks undermining science and public trust in scientific findings. To date, there has been comparatively little modelling on factors that influence science trustworthiness, despite the importance of quantifying the problem. We present a simple phenomenological model with cohorts of diligent, careless and unethical scientists, with funding allocated by published outputs. This analysis suggests that trustworthiness of published science in a given field is influenced by false positive rate, and pressures for positive results. We find decreasing available funding has negative consequences for resulting trustworthiness, and examine strategies to combat propagation of irreproducible science.},

As with any scientific method or technique, knowledge of the weaknesses that might render findings limited or potentially erroneous as well as strategies by which to mitigate these biases is essential for high-quality scientific evidence. In this paper, we focus on one prevalent consideration for meta-analytical investigations, namely dependency among effects. We provide readers with a non-technical introduction to and overview of statistical solutions for handling dependent effects for their efforts to integrate evidence within primary studies. This goal is achieved via a series of seven reflective questions that scholars might consider when planning and executing a meta-analysis in which some degree of dependency among effect sizes from primary studies may exist. We also provide an example application of the recommendations with real-world data, including an analytical script that readers can adapt for their own purposes.

This indicator takes into account not only the prestige of the citing scientific journal but also its closeness to the cited journal using the cosine of the angle between the vectors of the two journals' cocitation profiles. To eliminate the size effect, the accumulated prestige is divided by the fraction of the journal's citable documents, thus eliminating the decreasing tendency of this type of indicator and giving meaning to the scores. Its method of computation is described, and the results of its implementation on the Scopus 2008 dataset is compared with those of an ad hoc Journal Impact Factor, JIF(3y), and SNIP, the comparison being made both overall and within specific scientific areas. All three, the SJR2 indicator, the SNIP indicator and the JIF distributions, were found to fit well to a logarithmic law. Although the three metrics were strongly correlated, there were major changes in rank. In addition, the SJR2 was distributed more equalized than the JIF by Subject Area and almost as equalized as the SNIP, and better than both at the lower level of Specific Subject Areas. The incorporation of the cosine increased the values of the flows of prestige between thematically close journals.},

The lack of random sampling and its consequences for statistical inference are also highlighted, leading to the recommendation to dispense with inferences and perform approximate randomization tests instead. A possible scheme for the appraisal of substantive hypotheses is offered, the corroboration of which is a necessary prerequisite for scientific explanations and predictions. The scheme is partly based on the Neyman--Pearson theory. This theory, though not perfect, is superior to its competitors, especially when examining substantive hypotheses. The many statistical and extra-statistical decisions prior to experimentation and the inevitable subjectivity of our research endeavors are emphasized. If feasible, statistical problems should be discussed from an extra-statistical methodological/epistemological viewpoint.},

  abstract = {Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion. Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories (k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) that encompassed zero (d = 0.04, 95\% CI [?0.07, 0.15]. We discuss implications of the findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion model of self-control.},

Although these misinterpretations are well documented among students, until now there has been little research on pedagogical methods to remove them. Rather, they are considered "hard facts" that are impervious to correction.

  abstract = {Aerobic exercise training is a promising complementary treatment option in migraine and can reduce migraine days and improve retinal microvascular function. Our aim was to elucidate whether different aerobic exercise programs at high vs moderate intensities distinctly affect migraine days as primary outcome and retinal vessel parameters as a secondary. In this randomized controlled trial, migraine days were recorded by a validated migraine diary in 45 migraineurs of which 36 (female: 28; age: 36 (SD:10)/BMI: 23.1 (5.3) completed the training period (dropout: 20\%). Participants were assigned (Strata: age, gender, fitness and migraine symptomatology) to either high intensity interval training (HIT), moderate continuous training (MCT), or a control group (CON). Intervention groups trained twice a week over a 12-week intervention period. Static retinal vessel analysis, central retinal arteriolar (CRAE) and venular (CRVE) diameters, as well as the arteriolar-to-venular diameter ratio (AVR) were obtained for cerebrovascular health assessment. Incremental treadmill testing yielded maximal and submaximal fitness parameters. Overall, moderate migraine day reductions were observed ( = .12): HIT revealed 89\% likely beneficial effects (SMD = 1.05) compared to MCT (SMD = 0.50) and CON (SMD = 0.59). Very large intervention effects on AVR improvement ( = 0.27), slightly favoring HIT (SMD=-0.43) over CON (SMD=0), were observed. HIT seems more effective for migraine day reduction and improvement of cerebrovascular health compared to MCT. Intermittent exercise programs of higher intensities may need to be considered as an additional treatment option in migraine patients.},

  abstract = {Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (`analytic reproducibility'). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

A worked example demonstrates how to apply these statistical tools and interpret the results. Finally, we explain how no statistical approach can actually prove that the null-hypothesis is true, and briefly discuss the philosophical differences between statistical approaches to examine null-effects. The increasing availability of easy-to-use software and online tools to perform equivalence tests, Bayesian estimation, and calculate Bayes factors make it timely and feasible to complement or move beyond traditional null-hypothesis tests, and allow researchers to draw more informative conclusions about null-effects.},

This paper examined 258,050 test results across 30,710 articles from eight high impact journals to investigate the existence of a peculiar prevalence of p-values just below .05 (i.e., a bump) in the psychological literature, and a potential increase thereof over time. We indeed found evidence for a bump just below .05 in the distribution of exactly reported p-values in the journals Developmental Psychology, Journal of Applied Psychology, and Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, but the bump did not increase over the years and disappeared when using recalculated p-values. We found clear and direct evidence for the QRP ``incorrect rounding of p-value'' () in all psychology journals. Finally, we also investigated monotonic excess of p-values, an effect of certain QRPs that has been neglected in previous research, and developed two measures to detect this by modeling the distributions of statistically significant p-values. Using simulations and applying the two measures to the retrieved test results, we argue that, although one of the measures suggests the use of QRPs in psychology, it is difficult to draw general conclusions concerning QRPs based on modeling of p-value distributions.},

Investigating researchers in Amsterdam with the revised Publication Pressure Questionnaire, we find that a negative attitude towards the current publication climate is present across academic ranks and disciplinary fields. Postdocs and assistant professors (M = 3.42) perceive the greatest publication stress and PhD-students (M = 2.44) perceive a significant lack of resources to relieve publication stress.

Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

In some cases, effect size estimates are available only if the difference between experimental and control group means is statistically significant. If the quantitative result of a study is observed only when the mean difference is statistically significant, the observed mean difference, variance, and effect size are biased estimators of the corresponding population parameters. The exact distribution of the sample effect size is derived for the case in which only studies yielding statistically significant results may be observed. The maximum likelihood estimator of effect size also is derived under the model in which only significant results are observed. The exact distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is obtained numerically and is used to study the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator.

Statistical theory proposed previously has stressed the estimation of fixed but unknown population effect sizes (standardized mean differences). Theoretical considerations often suggest that treatment effects are not fixed but vary across different implementations of a treatment. The present author presents a random effects model (analogous to random effects ANOVA) in which the population effect sizes are not fixed but are sample realizations from a distribution of possible population effect sizes. An analogy to variance component estimation is used to derive an unbiased estimator of the variance of the effect-size distribution. An example shows that these methods may suggest insights that are not available from inspection of means and standard deviation of effect-size estimates.

This paper provides an estimator of the covariance matrix of meta-regression coefficients that are applicable when there are clusters of internally correlated estimates. It makes no assumptions about the specific form of the sampling distributions of the effect sizes, nor does it require knowledge of the covariance structure of the dependent estimates. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that the meta-regression coefficients are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed and that the robust variance estimator is valid even when the covariates are random. The theory is asymptotic in the number of studies, but simulations suggest that the theory may yield accurate results with as few as 20--40 studies.

All of these analyses are based on statistical methods used in meta-analysis. The differences among the methods described involve whether the burden of proof is placed on replication or nonreplication, whether replication is exact or allows for a small amount of "negligible heterogeneity," and whether the studies observed are assumed to be fixed (constituting the entire body of relevant evidence) or are a sample from a universe of possibly relevant studies.

  abstract = {Background To assess the extent and nature of claims regarding improved sports performance made by advertisers for a broad range of sports-related products, and the quality of the evidence on which these claims are based. Methods The authors analysed magazine adverts and associated websites of a broad range of sports products. The authors searched for references supporting the performance and/or recovery claims of these products. The authors critically appraised the methods in the retrieved references by assessing the level of evidence and the risk of bias. The authors also collected information on the included participants, adverse events, study limitations, the primary outcome of interest and whether the intervention had been retested. Results The authors viewed 1035 web pages and identified 431 performance-enhancing claims for 104 different products. The authors found 146 references that underpinned these claims. More than half (52.8\%) of the websites that made performance claims did not provide any references, and the authors were unable to perform critical appraisal for approximately half (72/146) of the identified references. None of the references referred to systematic reviews (level 1 evidence). Of the critically appraised studies, 84\% were judged to be at high risk of bias. Randomisation was used in just over half of the studies (58.1\%), allocation concealment was only clear in five (6.8\%) studies; and blinding of the investigators, outcome assessors or participants was only clearly reported as used in 20 (27.0\%) studies. Only three of the 74 (2.7\%) studies were judged to be of high quality and at low risk of bias. Conclusions The current evidence is not of sufficient quality to inform the public about the benefits and harms of sports products. There is a need to improve the quality and reporting of research, a move towards using systematic review evidence to inform decisions.},

This chapter considers outcome data of five common types: dichotomous (or binary) data, continuous data, ordinal data, count or rate data and time-to-event data. The ways in which the effect of an intervention can be assessed depend on the nature of the data being collected. For each of the types of data, the chapter reviews definitions, properties and interpretation of standard measures of intervention effect, and provides tips on how effect estimates may be computed from data likely to be reported in sources such as journal articles. Formulae to estimate effects for the commonly used effect measures are provided in a supplementary document statistical algorithms in Review Manager, as well as other standard textbooks. Effect measures are either ratio measures or difference measures. Ratio measures are typically analysed on a logarithmic scale.},

We show that, for parameter values derived from the scientific literature, researchers acting to maximise their fitness should spend most of their effort seeking novel results and conduct small studies that have only 10\%--40\% statistical power. As a result, half of the studies they publish will report erroneous conclusions. Current incentive structures are in conflict with maximising the scientific value of research; we suggest ways that the scientific ecosystem could be improved.},

Meta-analysis of longitudinal studies is often limited by the amount of published information on particular research questions, the complexity of longitudinal designs and the sophistication of analyses, and practical limits on full reporting of results. In many cases, cross-study differences in sample composition and measurements impede or lessen the utility of pooled data analysis. A collaborative, coordinated analysis approach can provide a broad foundation for cumulating scientific knowledge by facilitating efficient analysis of multiple studies in ways that maximize comparability of results and permit evaluation of study differences. The goal of such an approach is to maximize opportunities for replication and extension of findings across longitudinal studies through open access to analysis scripts and output for published results, permitting modification, evaluation, and extension of alternative statistical models and application to additional data sets. Drawing on the cognitive aging literature as an example, the authors articulate some of the challenges of meta-analytic and pooled-data approaches and introduce a coordinated analysis approach as an important avenue for maximizing the comparability, replication, and extension of results from longitudinal studies.},

Nine male and eight female cyclists and triathletes completed trials to determine their LT2 and 40 km cycling performance before, and after 10 HIIT sessions. Each HIIT session consisted of 10~{\texttimes}~90 s at peak power output, separated by 60 s active recovery. Main effects showed that HIIT improved peak power output (p~=~0.05; ES: 0.2); relative peak power output (W.kg-1; p~=~0.04; ES: 0.3 and W.kg-0.32; p~=~0.04; ES: 0.3); incremental time to fatigue (p~=~0.01; ES: 0.4), time trial time (p~{$<~$}0.001; ES: 0.7) and time trial power output (p~{$<~$}0.001; ES: 0.7) equally in both sexes. Although LT2 power output explained 77\% of the performance improvement in women, no variable explained the performance improvement in men, suggesting another mechanism(s) was involved. Although HIIT improved cycling performance in men and women, it might not be appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness of HIIT using the same variables for both sexes.},

  abstract = {It has often been reported that mental exertion, presumably leading to mental fatigue, can negatively affect exercise performance; however, recent findings have questioned the strength of the effect. To further complicate this issue, an overlooked problem might be the presence of publication bias in studies using underpowered designs, which is known to inflate false positive report probability and effect size estimates. Altogether, the presence of bias is likely to reduce the evidential value of the published literature on this topic, although it is unknown to what extent. The purpose of the current work was to assess the evidential value of studies published to date on the effect of mental exertion on exercise performance by assessing the presence of publication bias and the observed statistical power achieved by these studies. A traditional meta-analysis revealed a Cohen's dz effect size of -\,0.54, 95\% CI [-\,0.68, -\,0.40], p\,{$<$}\,.001. However, when we applied methods for estimating and correcting for publication bias (based on funnel plot asymmetry and observed p-values), we found that the bias-corrected effect size became negligible with most of publication-bias methods and decreased to -\,0.36 in the more optimistic of all the scenarios. A robust Bayesian meta-analysis found strong evidence in favor of publication bias, BFpb\,{$>$}\,1000, and inconclusive evidence in favor of the effect, adjusted dz\,=\,0.01, 95\% CrI [-\,0.46, 0.37], BF10\,=\,0.90. Furthermore, the median observed statistical power assuming the unadjusted meta-analytic effect size (i.e., -\,0.54) as the true effect size was 39\% (min\,=\,19\%, max\,=\,96\%), indicating that, on average, these studies only had a 39\% chance of observing a significant result if the true effect was Cohen's dz\,=\,-\,0.54. If the more optimistic adjusted effect size (-\,0.36) was assumed as the true effect, the median statistical power was just 20\%. We conclude that the current literature is a useful case study for illustrating the dangers of conducting underpowered studies to detect the effect size of interest.},

We measured power output, heart rate, (session) rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and subjective mental fatigue. Bayes factor analyses revealed extreme evidence supporting the alternative hypothesis that the mental fatigue task was more mentally fatiguing than the control task, BF01 = 0.009. However, we found moderate-to-strong evidence for the null hypothesis (i.e., no evidence of reduced performance) for average time in TTE (BF01 = 9.762) and anecdotal evidence for the null hypothesis in (session) RPE (BF01 = 2.902) and heart rate (BF01 = 2.587). Our data seem to challenge the idea that mental fatigue has a negative influence on exercise performance. Although we did succeed at manipulating subjective mental fatigue, this did not impair physical performance. However, we cannot discard the possibility that mental fatigue may have a negative influence under conditions not explored here, e.g., individualizing mentally fatiguing tasks. In sum, further research is warranted to determine the role of mental fatigue on exercise and sport performance.},

This issue has attracted attention from several fields, including sport and exercise sciences. In fact, a considerable body of literature in the sport science field has suggested that performing a long and demanding cognitive task might lead to a state of mental fatigue, impairing subsequent exercise performance, although research in this field has shown contradictory results. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate these inconsistent findings. The analysis yielded small-to-medium effects of mental fatigue on exercise performance, dz = 0.50, and RPE, dz = 0.21. However, a three-parameter selection model also revealed evidence of publication or reporting biases, suggesting that the bias-corrected estimates might be substantially lower (0.08 and 0.10, respectively) and non-significant. In sum, current evidence does not provide conclusive support for the claim that mental fatigue has a negative influence on exercise performance.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses typically quantify heterogeneity of results, thus providing information about the consistency of the investigated effect across studies. Numerous heterogeneity estimators have been devised. Past evaluations of their performance typically presumed lack of bias in the set of studies being meta-analysed, which is often unrealistic. The present study used computer simulations to evaluate five heterogeneity estimators under a range of research conditions broadly representative of meta-analyses in psychology, with the aim to assess the impact of biases in sets of primary studies on estimates of both mean effect size and heterogeneity in meta-analyses of continuous outcome measures. To this end, six orthogonal design factors were manipulated: Strength of publication bias; 1-tailed vs. 2-tailed publication bias; prevalence of p-hacking; true heterogeneity of the effect studied; true average size of the studied effect; and number of studies per meta-analysis. Our results showed that biases in sets of primary studies caused much greater problems for the estimation of effect size than for the estimation of heterogeneity. For the latter, estimation bias remained small or moderate under most circumstances. Effect size estimations remained virtually unaffected by the choice of heterogeneity estimator. For heterogeneity estimates, however, relevant differences emerged. For unbiased primary studies, the REML estimator and (to a lesser extent) the Paule-Mandel performed well in terms of bias and variance. In biased sets of primary studies however, the Paule-Mandel estimator performed poorly, whereas the DerSimonian-Laird estimator and (to a slightly lesser extent) the REML estimator performed well. The complexity of results notwithstanding, we suggest that the REML estimator remains a good choice for meta-analyses of continuous outcome measures across varied circumstances.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to show how Monte Carlo analysis of meta-analytic estimators can be used to select estimators for specific research situations. Our analysis conducts 1620 individual experiments, where each experiment is defined by a unique combination of sample size, effect size, effect size heterogeneity, publication selection mechanism, and other research characteristics. We compare 11 estimators commonly used in medicine, psychology, and the social sciences. These are evaluated on the basis of bias, mean squared error (MSE), and coverage rates. For our experimental design, we reproduce simulation environments from four recent studies. We demonstrate that relative estimator performance differs across performance measures. Estimator performance is a complex interaction of performance indicator and aspects of the application. An estimator that may be especially good with respect to MSE may perform relatively poorly with respect to coverage rates. We also show that the size of the meta-analyst's sample and effect heterogeneity are important determinants of relative estimator performance. We use these results to demonstrate how these observable characteristics can guide the meta-analyst to choose the most appropriate estimator for their research circumstances.},

  abstract = {Statistical guidelines and expert statements are now available to assist in the analysis and reporting of studies in some biomedical disciplines. We present here a more progressive resource for sample-based studies, meta-analyses, and case studies in sports medicine and exercise science. We offer forthright advice on the following controversial or novel issues: using precision of estimation for inferences about population effects in preference to null-hypothesis testing, which is inadequate for assessing clinical or practical importance; justifying sample size via acceptable precision or confidence for clinical decisions rather than via adequate power for statistical significance; showing SD rather than SEM, to better communicate the magnitude of differences in means and nonuniformity of error; avoiding purely nonparametric analyses, which cannot provide inferences about magnitude and are unnecessary; using regression statistics in validity studies, in preference to the impractical and biased limits of agreement; making greater use of qualitative methods to enrich sample-based quantitative projects; and seeking ethics approval for public access to the depersonalized raw data of a study, to address the need for more scrutiny of research and better meta-analyses. Advice on less contentious issues includes the following: using covariates in linear models to adjust for confounders, to account for individual differences, and to identify potential mechanisms of an effect; using log transformation to deal with nonuniformity of effects and error; identifying and deleting outliers; presenting descriptive, effect, and inferential statistics in appropriate formats; and contending with bias arising from problems with sampling, assignment, blinding, measurement error, and researchers' prejudices. This article should advance the field by stimulating debate, promoting innovative approaches, and serving as a useful checklist for authors, reviewers, and editors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of non-blinded outcome assessment on estimated treatment effects in randomised clinical trials with binary outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review of trials with both blinded and non-blinded assessment of the same binary outcome. For each trial we calculated the ratio of the odds ratios--the odds ratio from non-blinded assessments relative to the corresponding odds ratio from blinded assessments. A ratio of odds ratios {$<$}1 indicated that non-blinded assessors generated more optimistic effect estimates than blinded assessors. We pooled the individual ratios of odds ratios with inverse variance random effects meta-analysis and explored reasons for variation in ratios of odds ratios with meta-regression. We also analysed rates of agreement between blinded and non-blinded assessors and calculated the number of patients needed to be reclassified to neutralise any bias. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, HighWire Press, and Google Scholar. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised clinical trials with blinded and non-blinded assessment of the same binary outcome. RESULTS: We included 21 trials in the main analysis (with 4391 patients); eight trials provided individual patient data. Outcomes in most trials were subjective--for example, qualitative assessment of the patient's function. The ratio of the odds ratios ranged from 0.02 to 14.4. The pooled ratio of odds ratios was 0.64 (95\% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.96), indicating an average exaggeration of the non-blinded odds ratio by 36\%. We found no significant association between low ratios of odds ratios and scores for outcome subjectivity (P=0.27); non-blinded assessor's overall involvement in the trial (P=0.60); or outcome vulnerability to non-blinded patients (P=0.52). Blinded and non-blinded assessors agreed in a median of 78\% of assessments (interquartile range 64-90\%) in the 12 trials with available data. The exaggeration of treatment effects associated with non-blinded assessors was induced by the misclassification of a median of 3\% of the assessed patients per trial (1-7\%). CONCLUSIONS: On average, non-blinded assessors of subjective binary outcomes generated substantially biased effect estimates in randomised clinical trials, exaggerating odds ratios by 36\%. This bias was compatible with a high rate of agreement between blinded and non-blinded outcome assessors and driven by the misclassification of few patients.},

We wanted to evaluate the effect of nonblinded outcome assessment on estimated effects in randomized clinical trials with outcomes that involved subjective measurement scales. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials with both blinded and nonblinded assessment of the same measurement scale outcome. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, HighWire Press and Google Scholar for relevant studies. Two investigators agreed on the inclusion of trials and the outcome scale. For each trial, we calculated the difference in effect size (i.e., standardized mean difference between nonblinded and blinded assessments). A difference in effect size of less than 0 suggested that nonblinded assessors generated more optimistic estimates of effect. We pooled the differences in effect size using inverse variance random-effects meta-analysis and used metaregression to identify potential reasons for variation. Results: We included 24 trials in our review. The main meta-analysis included 16 trials (involving 2854 patients) with subjective outcomes. The estimated treatment effect was more beneficial when based on nonblinded assessors (pooled difference in effect size -0.23 [95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.40 to -0.06]). In relative terms, nonblinded assessors exaggerated the pooled effect size by 68\% (95\% CI 14\% to 230\%). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 = 46\%, p = 0.02) and unexplained by metaregression. Interpretation: We provide empirical evidence for observer bias in randomized clinical trials with subjective measurement scale outcomes. A failure to blind assessors of outcomes in such trials results in a high risk of substantial bias.},

We  conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare existing treatments, which  include four classes of antidiabetic drugs, and examined the optimum treatments  for NAFLD. AIM: To compare the effectiveness of different treatments for NAFLD.  METHODS: An NMA was conducted using Stata 14.0 (Corporation LLC, College Station,  United States) and R (X64 3.6.3 version) in this study. Eligible randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) were searched in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase,  Medline and Web of Science databases from database inception to April 2021. Two  researchers independently screened the available studies in strict accordance  with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to  evaluate the risk of bias of the included studies. The variables with and without  dimensional differences were calculated as the standardized mean difference and  weighted mean difference, respectively. An inconsistency model and  "node-splitting" technique were used to test for inconsistency. Funnel plots were  used to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible RCTs involving  1377 participants were eventually included in our analysis. Data were pooled  using a random-effects model. Our NMA results revealed that glucagon-like  peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were the most effective treatment,  yielding improvements in hepatic fat content (HFC), alanine aminotransferase  (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum {$\gamma$}-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and  body weight [surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) = 99.6\%, 92.6\%,  82.8\%, 92.3\% and 99.6\%, respectively], while thiazolidinediones (TZDs) were the  best intervention for reducing the NAFLD activity score (NAS; SUCRA = 98.9\%). In  addition, moderate performance was observed for the sodium glucose  cotransporter-2 inhibitors groups (SUCRA = 25.1\%, 66.2\%, 63.5\%, 58.2\% and 71.9\%  for HFC, ALT, AST, GGT and body weight, respectively). However, metformin  performed poorly according to most indicators (SUCRA = 54.5\%, 0.3\%, 19.5\%, 33.7\%,  57.7\% and 44.3\% for HFC, NAS, ALT, AST, GGT and body weight, respectively).  CONCLUSION: GLP-1RAs may be the optimum choice for most patients with NAFLD.  However, TZDs are considered the most effective therapies in NAFLD patients with  histological disease activity.},

  abstract = {Confusion surrounding the reporting and interpretation of results of classical statistical tests is widespread among applied researchers, most of whom erroneously believe that such tests are prescribed by a single coherent theory of statistical inference. This is not the case: Classical statistical testing is an anonymous hybrid of the competing and frequently contradictory approaches formulated by R. A. Fisher on the one hand, and Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson on the other. In particular, there is a widespread failure to appreciate the incompatibility of Fisher's evidential p value with the Type I error rate, a, of Neyman-Pearson statistical orthodoxy. The distinction between evidence (p's) and error ({$\alpha$}'s) is not trivial. Instead, it reflects the fundamental differences between Fisher's ideas on significance testing and inductive inference, and Neyman-Pearson's views on hypothesis testing and inductive behavior. The emphasis of the article is to expose this incompatibility, but we also briefly note a possible reconciliation.}

Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value as playing a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an `objective' measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis. We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective and inadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. A common theme throughout many of these reasons is that p values exaggerate the evidence against H0. This, in turn, calls into question the validity of much published work based on comparatively small, including .05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed about the limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, this inferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity. Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics, effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle for reliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would also have agreed with the need for replication research.},

However, the Q test only informs meta-analysts about the presence versus the absence of heterogeneity, but it does not report on the extent of such heterogeneity. Recently, the I(2) index has been proposed to quantify the degree of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis. In this article, the performances of the Q test and the confidence interval around the I(2) index are compared by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. The results show the utility of the I(2) index as a complement to the Q test, although it has the same problems of power with a small number of studies.},

  abstract = {Objectives Evaluating the variation in the strength of the effect across studies is a key feature of meta-analyses. This variability is reflected by measures like {$\tau$}2 or I2, but their clinical interpretation is not straightforward. A prediction interval is less complicated: it presents the expected range of true effects in similar studies. We aimed to show the advantages of having the prediction interval routinely reported in meta-analyses. Design We show how the prediction interval can help understand the uncertainty about whether an intervention works or not. To evaluate the implications of using this interval to interpret the results, we selected the first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issues 2009--2013 with a dichotomous (n=2009) or continuous (n=1254) outcome, and generated 95\% prediction intervals for them. Results In 72.4\% of 479 statistically significant (random-effects p{$<$}0.05) meta-analyses in the Cochrane Database 2009--2013 with heterogeneity (I2{$>$}0), the 95\% prediction interval suggested that the intervention effect could be null or even be in the opposite direction. In 20.3\% of those 479 meta-analyses, the prediction interval showed that the effect could be completely opposite to the point estimate of the meta-analysis. We demonstrate also how the prediction interval can be used to calculate the probability that a new trial will show a negative effect and to improve the calculations of the power of a new trial. Conclusions The prediction interval reflects the variation in treatment effects over different settings, including what effect is to be expected in future patients, such as the patients that a clinician is interested to treat. Prediction intervals should be routinely reported to allow more informative inferences in meta-analyses.},

Their efforts have raised awareness of how badly meta-analyses can mislead when the articles that go into them are products of publication bias. Despite our genuine enthusiasm for their work, we worry that in their zeal to correct the record of publication bias, they have drawn too heavily on largely untested statistical techniques that can be insensitive and sometimes misleading. We tested a set of bias-correction techniques, including those favored by Carter and colleagues, by simulating 40,000 meta-analyses in a range of situations that approximate what is found in the ego depletion literature, most notably the presence of heterogeneous effects filtered by publication bias. Our simulations revealed that not one of the bias-correction techniques revealed itself superior in all conditions, with corrections performing adequately in some situations but inadequately in others. Such a result implies that meta-analysts ought to present a range of possible effect sizes and to consider them all as being possible. The problem with the ego depletion literature is that the bias-corrected estimates for the overall effect do not converge, with estimates ranging from g=0 to g=0.24 to g=0.26. Despite our admiration for this program of meta-research, we suggest that bias-corrected meta-analyses cannot yet resolve whether the overall ego depletion is different from zero or not.},

Empirical data suggest that across the biomedical literature (1990--2015), when abstracts use P values 96\% of them have P values of 0.05 or less. The same percentage (96\%) applies for full-text articles. Among 100 articles in PubMed, 55 report P values, while only 4 present confidence intervals for all the reported effect sizes, none use Bayesian methods and none use false-discovery rate. Over 25 years (1990--2015), use of P values in abstracts has doubled for all PubMed, and tripled for meta-analyses, while for some types of designs such as randomized trials the majority of abstracts report P values. There is major selective reporting for P values. Abstracts tend to highlight most favorable P values and inferences use even further spin to reach exaggerated, unreliable conclusions. The availability of large-scale data on P values from many papers has allowed the development and applications of methods that try to detect and model selection biases, for example, p-hacking, that cause patterns of excess significance. Inferences need to be cautious as they depend on the assumptions made by these models and can be affected by the presence of other biases (e.g., confounding in observational studies). While much of the unreliability of past and present research is driven by small, underpowered studies, NHST with P values may be also particularly problematic in the era of overpowered big data. NHST and P values are optimal only in a minority of current research. Using a more stringent threshold, as in the recently proposed shift from P {$<$} 0.05 to P {$<$} 0.005, is a temporizing measure to contain the flood and death-by-significance. NHST and P values may be replaced in many fields by other, more fit-for-purpose, inferential methods. However, curtailing selection biases requires additional measures, beyond changes in inferential methods, and in particular reproducible research practices.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

However, replicating researchers are constrained by resources, and will almost always have to choose one replication effort to focus on from a set of potential candidates. To select a candidate efficiently in these cases, we need methods for deciding which out of all candidates considered would be the most useful to replicate, given some overall goal researchers wish to achieve. In this article we assume that the overall goal researchers wish to achieve is to maximize the utility gained by conducting the replication study. We then propose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the replication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The replication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we could gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a) the value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim based on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal decision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph modeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of expected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative estimates of replication value. Our goal in this article is not to define concrete guidelines for study selection, but to provide the necessary theoretical foundations on which such concrete guidelines could be built.

Biomechanical data were collected while 28 dancers performed saut de chat leaps with instructions to jump far (FAR) or jump high (UP). In the UP condition, there was greater vertical GRF and less braking GRF. Also in UP, lower extremity contact angle was greater (71.3 {\textpm} 2.9º FAR; 75.8 {\textpm} 3.3º UP; p = 0.0178), peak knee extensor moment was greater (2.8 {\textpm} 0.7 Nm FAR; 3.2 {\textpm} 0.8 Nm UP; p = 0.01), and peak ankle plantar flexor moment was lower (3.19 {\textpm} 0.4 Nm FAR; 2.94 {\textpm} 0.4 Nm UP; p {$<$} 0.01). A more acute LECA was related to greater braking force and braking force was related to greater knee extensor moments. Despite these relationships, we observed greater knee extensor moments in UP. While the relationship among these whole-body variables and knee joint loading exists, it may not be the primary factor driving load distribution during dance leap landings.},

The analysis is based on data obtained from a Mock Research Quality Framework (RQF) exercise conducted by Monash University during 2006--07 in which external assessors rated research articles for their quality using a five-point scale. Although a significant relationship exists between all three bibliometric variables and the overall Mock RQF assessor quality scores, only a relatively small amount of the variance (generally {$<$}20 per cent) could be explained. There is some evidence that the relationship is stronger within some disciplinary groupings than others.

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the physiological responses between a vibration induced cycling step protocol (Vib) and normal cycling (without vibration, no-Vib). Eighteen moderate trained males (age 24.1 {\textpm} 4.3 years; weight 76.5 {\textpm} 10.5 kg; height 178.0 {\textpm} 6.4 cm) have participated in this study. They randomly performed two gradual maximal exercise tests on two separate days using a new bike that automatically induces vibration cycling and the Corival cycle ergometer. The choice of two different bikes was made because of the impossibility to recreate the same power output without altering the cycling cadence on the vibration Bike. Both protocols were matched for power output and cycling cadence incrementations. Oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), ventilation (VE), heart rate (HR), blood lactate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during each stage were continuously recorded. No statistical differences were founded for all variables when comparing the Vib to no-Vib trials, except a higher ventilation during the vibration trial at submaximal levels. The results of this study do not confirm those of previous studies stated that Vib increased metabolic demands during cycling exercise. Added vibration stimulus to an incremental cycling protocol does not affect physiological parameters.}

  abstract = {Significance testing based on p-values is standard in psychological research and teaching. Typically, research articles and textbooks present and use p as a measure of statistical evidence against the null hypothesis (the Fisherian interpretation), although using concepts and tools based on a completely different usage of p as a tool for controlling long-term decision errors (the Neyman-Pearson interpretation). There are four major problems with using p as a measure of evidence and these problems are often overlooked in the domain of psychology. First, p is uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis and can therefore never indicate evidence for the null. Second, p is conditioned solely on the null hypothesis and is therefore unsuited to quantify evidence, because evidence is always relative in the sense of being evidence for or against a hypothesis relative to another hypothesis. Third, p designates probability of obtaining evidence (given the null), rather than strength of evidence. Fourth, p depends on unobserved data and subjective intentions and therefore implies, given the evidential interpretation, that the evidential strength of observed data depends on things that did not happen and subjective intentions. In sum, using p in the Fisherian sense as a measure of statistical evidence is deeply problematic, both statistically and conceptually, while the Neyman-Pearson interpretation is not about evidence at all. In contrast, the likelihood ratio escapes the above problems and is recommended as a tool for psychologists to represent the statistical evidence conveyed by obtained data relative to two hypotheses.},

Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

In an era in which the need for greater research transparency is paramount, inadequate reporting hinders assessment of the reliability and validity of trial findings. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 Statement was developed to improve the reporting of randomized clinical trials, but the primary focus was on parallel-group trials with 2 groups. Multi-arm trials that use a parallel-group design (comparing treatments by concurrently randomizing participants to one of the treatment groups, usually with equal probability) but have 3 or more groups are relatively common. The quality of reporting of multi-arm trials varies substantially, making judgments and interpretation difficult. While the majority of the elements of the CONSORT 2010 Statement apply equally to multi-arm trials, some elements need adaptation, and, in some cases, additional issues need to be clarified.To present an extension to the CONSORT 2010 Statement for reporting multi-arm trials to facilitate the reporting of such trials.A guideline writing group, which included all authors, formed following the CONSORT group meeting in 2014. The authors met in person and by teleconference bimonthly between 2014 and 2018 to develop and revise the checklist and the accompanying text, with additional discussions by email. A draft manuscript was circulated to the wider CONSORT group of 36 individuals, plus 5 other selected individuals known for their specialist knowledge in clinical trials, for review. Extensive feedback was received from 14 individuals and, after detailed consideration of their comments, a final revised version of the extension was prepared.This CONSORT extension for multi-arm trials expands on 10 items of the CONSORT 2010 checklist and provides examples of good reporting and a rationale for the importance of each extension item. Key recommendations are that multi-arm trials should be identified as such and require clear objectives and hypotheses referring to all of the treatment groups. Primary treatment comparisons should be identified and authors should report the planned and unplanned comparisons resulting from multiple groups completely and transparently. If statistical adjustments for multiplicity are applied, the rationale and method used should be described.This extension of the CONSORT 2010 Statement provides specific guidance for the reporting of multi-arm parallel-group randomized clinical trials and should help provide greater transparency and accuracy in the reporting of such trials.},

Data Sources The Web of Science, PubMed, and Retraction Watch databases were searched from inception to August~2019. Study Selection Retracted publications published in rehabilitation or sport sciences journals, indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) were included. Data Extraction One author extracted the data. Two other authors checked the data. Data Synthesis A total of 37 and 52 retracted publications and their retraction notices were identified for rehabilitation and sport sciences, respectively. The majority of retracted publications (68\% of all retracted papers in rehabilitation and 54\% of all retracted papers in sport sciences) were published in the past decade. Retracted publications in rehabilitation and sport sciences were published in 21 and 22 different journals and originated from 18 and 21 different countries, respectively. The full-text of the retracted publications was available with a retraction watermark or note for 59\% of cases in rehabilitation and 58\% in sport sciences. The reasons for the retractions were more often attributed to misconduct (79\% and 61\%) than to honest error (21\% and 39\%) in rehabilitation and sport sciences, respectively. However, a reason was not stated for 15\% of the publications. The median time interval between publication and retraction was 622 days in rehabilitation and 607 days in sport sciences publications. Conclusions The total number of retracted publications in rehabilitation and sport sciences journals was small. The retracted publications have been published in a variety of rehabilitation and sport sciences journals and came from different countries across the world. Several retracted publications and retraction notices failed to adhere to The Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines in the handling of full-text (retain with a watermark or note) or stating the underlying reasons for the retraction.},

Faculty included Richard Keefe, PhD; James McNulty, AbScB; Robert S. Epstein, MD, MS; Shelby D. Reed, PhD; Juan Sanchez, MD; Ginger Haynes, PhD; Andrew C. Leon, PhD; Helena Chmura Kraemer, PhD; Ellen Frank, PhD, and Kenneth L. Davis, MD., Results: The term clinically meaningful effect is an important aspect of designing and interpreting randomized controlled trials but can be particularly difficult in the setting of psychopharmacology where effect size may be modest, particularly over the short term, because of a strong response to placebo. Payers, regulators, patients, and clinicians have different concerns about clinically meaningful effects and may describe these terms differently. The use of moderators in success rate differences may help better delineate clinically meaningful effects., Conclusion: There is no clear consensus on a single definition for clinically meaningful differences in randomized controlled trials, and investigators must be sensitive to specific concerns of stakeholders in psychopharmacology in order to design and execute appropriate clinical trials.},

However, there is confusion in the literature on the definition of effect size, and consequently the term is used inconsistently. We propose a definition for effect size, discuss 3 facets of effect size (dimension, measure/index, and value), outline 10 corollaries that follow from our definition, and review ideal qualities of effect sizes. Our definition of effect size is general and subsumes many existing definitions of effect size. We define effect size as a quantitative reflection of the magnitude of some phenomenon that is used for the purpose of addressing a question of interest. Our definition of effect size is purposely more inclusive than the way many have defined and conceptualized effect size, and it is unique with regard to linking effect size to a question of interest. Additionally, we review some important developments in the effect size literature and discuss the importance of accompanying an effect size with an interval estimate that acknowledges the uncertainty with which the population value of the effect size has been estimated. We hope that this article will facilitate discussion and improve the practice of reporting and interpreting effect sizes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Such variation is even found in exact replication studies, suggesting that it is not only because of identifiable moderators but also to subtler random variation across studies. Such heterogeneity of effect sizes is typically ignored, with unfortunate consequences. We consider its implications for power analyses, the precision of estimated effects, and the planning of original and replication research. With heterogeneity and an interest in generalizing to a population of studies, the usual power calculations and confidence intervals are likely misleading, and the preference for single definitive large-N studies is misguided.

  abstract = {Publication bias poses multiple threats to the accuracy of meta-analytically derived effect sizes and related statistics. Unfortunately, a review of the literature indicates that unlike meta-analytic reviews in medicine, research in the organizational sciences tends to pay little attention to this issue. In this article, the authors introduce advances in meta-analytic techniques from the medical and related sciences for a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of publication bias. The authors illustrate their use on a data set on employment interview validities. Using multiple methods, including contour-enhanced funnel plots, trim and fill, Egger's test of the intercept, Begg and Mazumdar's rank correlation, meta-regression, cumulative meta-analysis, and selection models, the authors find limited evidence of publication bias in the studied data.},

  abstract = {Questionable research practices (QRPs) among researchers have been a source of concern in many fields of study. QRPs are often used to enhance the probability of achieving statistical significance which affects the likelihood of a paper being published. Using a sample of researchers from 10 top research-productive management programs, we compared hypotheses tested in dissertations to those tested in journal articles derived from those dissertations to draw inferences concerning the extent of engagement in QRPs. Results indicated that QRPs related to changes in sample size and covariates were associated with unsupported dissertation hypotheses becoming supported in journal articles. Researchers also tended to exclude unsupported dissertation hypotheses from journal articles. Likewise, results suggested that many article hypotheses may have been created after the results were known (i.e., HARKed). Articles from prestigious journals contained a higher percentage of potentially HARKed hypotheses than those from less well-regarded journals. Finally, articles published in prestigious journals were associated with more QRP usage than less prestigious journals. QRPs increase in the percentage of supported hypotheses and result in effect sizes that likely overestimate population parameters. As such, results reported in articles published in our most prestigious journals may be less credible than previously believed.},

HARKing is defined as presenting a post hoc hypothesis (i.e., one based on or informed by one's results) in one's research report as if it were, in fact, an a priori hypotheses. Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},

This research tested variation in the replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36 independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10 effects replicated consistently. One effect -- imagined contact reducing prejudice -- showed weak support for replicability. And two effects -- flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing system justification -- did not replicate. We compared whether the conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to investigate the effect.},

One strategy to maximize replication quality is involving the original authors in study design. We (N = 21 Labs and N = 2,220 participants) experimentally tested whether original author involvement improved replicability of a classic finding from Terror Management Theory (Greenberg et al., 1994). Our results were non-diagnostic of whether original author involvement improves replicability because we were unable to replicate the finding under any conditions. This suggests that the original finding was either a false positive or the conditions necessary to obtain it are not yet understood or no longer exist.

  abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {$<$} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {$<$} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely highpowered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen's ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({$<$} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

It is unclear if this problem of "promiscuous coauthorship" or "hyperauthorship" (defined as six or more authors) is also apparent in the applied research disciplines within sport and exercise science. This study documented the authorship and sampling of patterns of original research reports in three applied biomechanics (Clinical Biomechanics, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, and Sports Biomechanics) and five similar subdisciplinary journals within sport and exercise science (International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance, Journal of Sport Rehabilitation, Journal of Teaching Physical Education, Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Sciences, and Motor Control). Original research reports from the 2009 volumes of these biomechanics and sport and exercise journals were reviewed. Single authorship of papers was rare (2.6\%) in these journals, with the mean number of authors ranging from 2.7 to 4.5. Sample sizes and the ratio of sample to authors varied widely, and these variables tended not to be associated with number of authors. Original research reports published in these journals in 2009 tended to be published by small teams of collaborators, so currently there may be few problems with promiscuous coauthorship in these subdisciplines of sport and exercise science.},

  abstract = {Objective Sprint exercise and hypoxic stimulus during exercise are potent factors affecting hormonal and metabolic responses. However, the effects of different hypoxic levels on hormonal and metabolic responses during sprint exercise are not known. Here, we examined the effect of different hypoxic conditions on hormonal and metabolic responses during sprint exercise. Design Seven male subjects participated in three experimental trials: 1) sprint exercise under normoxia (NSE); 2) sprint exercise under moderate normobaric hypoxia (16.4\% oxygen) (HSE 16.4); and 3) sprint exercise under severe normobaric hypoxia (13.6\% oxygen) (HSE 13.6). The sprint exercise consisted of four 30s all-out cycling bouts with 4-min rest between bouts. Glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), blood lactate, growth hormone (GH), epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and insulin concentrations in the HSE trials were measured before exposure to hypoxia (pre 1), 15min after exposure to hypoxia (pre 2), and at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180min after the exercise performed in hypoxia. The blood samples in the NSE trial were obtained in normoxia at the same time points as the HSE trials. Results Circulating levels of glucose, FFA, lactate, GH, E, NE, and insulin significantly increased after all three exercise trials (P{$<$}0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for GH was significantly higher in the HSE 13.6 trial than in the NSE and HSE 16.4 trials (P{$<$}0.05). A maximal increase in FFA concentration was observed at 180min after exercise and was not different between trials. Conclusion These findings suggest that severe hypoxia may be an important factor for the enhancement of GH response to all-out sprint exercise.},

In this article, I present five broad guidelines for interpreting effect sizes that are applicable across the social sciences. I then propose a more structured schema with new empirical benchmarks for interpreting a specific class of studies: causal research on education interventions with standardized achievement outcomes. Together, these tools provide a practical approach for incorporating study features, costs, and scalability into the process of interpreting the policy importance of effect sizes.},

  abstract = {Continued timing observations of the double pulsar PSR J0737--3039A/B, which consists of two active radio pulsars (A and B) that orbit each other with a period of 2.45 h in a mildly eccentric (e=0.088) binary system, have led to large improvements in the measurement of relativistic effects in this system. With a 16-yr data span, the results enable precision tests of theories of gravity for strongly self-gravitating bodies and also reveal new relativistic effects that have been expected but are now observed for the first time. These include effects of light propagation in strong gravitational fields which are currently not testable by any other method. In particular, we observe the effects of retardation and aberrational light bending that allow determination of the spin direction of the pulsar. In total, we detect seven post-Keplerian parameters in this system, more than for any other known binary pulsar. For some of these effects, the measurement precision is now so high that for the first time we have to take higher-order contributions into account. These include the contribution of the A pulsar's effective mass loss (due to spin-down) to the observed orbital period decay, a relativistic deformation of the orbit, and the effects of the equation of state of superdense matter on the observed post-Keplerian parameters via relativistic spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the implications of our findings, including those for the moment of inertia of neutron stars, and present the currently most precise test of general relativity's quadrupolar description of gravitational waves, validating the prediction of general relativity at a level of 1.3{\texttimes}10-4 with 95\% confidence. We demonstrate the utility of the double pulsar for tests of alternative theories of gravity by focusing on two specific examples and also discuss some implications of the observations for studies of the interstellar medium and models for the formation of the double pulsar system. Finally, we provide context to other types of related experiments and prospects for the future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade/score is derived from a validated nomogram to objectively assess prognosis and liver function in patients  with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this post hoc analysis, we assessed  prognosis in terms of survival by baseline ALBI grade and monitored liver  function during treatment with ramucirumab or placebo using the ALBI score in  patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class  A with prior sorafenib treatment were randomised in REACH trials to receive  ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo every 2 weeks. Data were analysed by trial and as  a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data (pooled population) from REACH  (alpha-fetoprotein {$\geq$}400 ng/ml) and REACH-2. Patients from REACH with Child-Pugh  class B were analysed as a separate cohort. The ALBI grades and scores were  calculated at baseline and before each treatment cycle. RESULTS: Baseline  characteristics by ALBI grade were balanced between treatment arms among patients  in the pooled population (ALBI-1, n~= 231; ALBI-2, n~= 296; ALBI-3, n~= 7).  Baseline ALBI grade was prognostic for overall survival (OS; ALBI grade 2 vs. 1;  hazard ratio [HR]: 1.38 [1.13-1.69]), after adjusting for other significant  prognostic factors. Mean ALBI scores remained stable in both treatment arms  compared with baseline and were unaffected by baseline ALBI grade, macrovascular  invasion, tumour response, geographical region, or prior locoregional therapy.  Baseline ALBI grades 2 and 3 were associated with increased incidence of  liver-specific adverse events and discontinuation rates in both treatments.  Ramucirumab improved OS in patients with baseline ALBI grade 1 (HR 0.605  [0.445-0.824]) and ALBI grade 2 (HR 0.814 [0.630-1.051]). CONCLUSIONS: Compared  with placebo, ramucirumab did not negatively impact liver function and improved  survival irrespective of baseline ALBI grade. LAY SUMMARY: Hepatocellular  carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Prognosis  is affected by many clinical factors including liver function both before and  during anticancer treatment. Here we have used a validated approach to assess  liver function using 2 laboratory parameters, serum albumin and bilirubin (ALBI),  both before and during treatment with ramucirumab in 2 phase III  placebo-controlled studies. We confirm the practicality of using this more  simplistic approach in assessing liver function prior to and during anticancer  therapy, and demonstrate ramucirumab did not impair liver function when compared  with placebo.},

Therefore, additional reporting of effect size is often recommended. Effect sizes are theoretically independent from sample size. Yet this may not hold true empirically: non-independence could indicate publication bias. Methods We investigate whether effect size is independent from sample size in psychological research. We randomly sampled 1,000 psychological articles from all areas of psychological research. We extracted p values, effect sizes, and sample sizes of all empirical papers, and calculated the correlation between effect size and sample size, and investigated the distribution of p values. Results We found a negative correlation of r = -.45 [95\% CI: -.53; -.35] between effect size and sample size. In addition, we found an inordinately high number of p values just passing the boundary of significance. Additional data showed that neither implicit nor explicit power analysis could account for this pattern of findings. Conclusion The negative correlation between effect size and samples size, and the biased distribution of p values indicate pervasive publication bias in the entire field of psychology.},

Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results.

  abstract = {When designing a study, the planned sample size is often based on power analyses. One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index ({$\eta^2$}, {$\omega^2$} and {$\varepsilon^2$}) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of {$\eta^2$} in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies. Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue.

The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification.

Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area.

  abstract = {Running studies with high statistical power, while effect size estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research. Copyright {\copyright} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

They concluded there is a `surge of p-values between 0.041--0.049 in recent decades' which `suggests (but does not prove) questionable research practices have increased over the past 25 years.' I show the changes in the ratio of fractions of p-values between 0.041--0.049 over the years are better explained by assuming the average power has decreased over time. Furthermore, I propose that their observation that p-values just below 0.05 increase more strongly than p-values above 0.05 can be explained by an increase in publication bias (or the file drawer effect) over the years (cf. ; , which has led to a relative decrease of `marginally significant' p-values in abstracts in the literature (instead of an increase in p-values just below 0.05). I explain why researchers analyzing large numbers of p-values need to relate their assumptions to a model of p-value distributions that takes into account the average power of the performed studies, the ratio of true positives to false positives in the literature, the effects of publication bias, and the Type 1 error rate (and possible mechanisms through which it has inflated). Finally, I discuss why publication bias and underpowered studies might be a bigger problem for science than inflated Type 1 error rates, and explain the challenges when attempting to draw conclusions about inflated Type 1 error rates from a large heterogeneous set of p-values.},

It is essential that meta-analyses can easily be reproduced to allow researchers to evaluate the impact of subjective choices on meta-analytic effect sizes, but also to update meta-analyses as new data comes in, or as novel statistical techniques (for example to correct for publication bias) are developed. Research in medicine has revealed meta-analyses often cannot be reproduced. In this project, we examined the reproducibility of meta-analyses in psychology by reproducing twenty published meta-analyses. Reproducing published meta-analyses was surprisingly difficult. 96\% of meta-analyses published in 2013-2014 did not adhere to reporting guidelines. A third of these meta-analyses did not contain a table specifying all individual effect sizes. Five of the 20 randomly selected meta-analyses we attempted to reproduce could not be reproduced at all due to lack of access to raw data, no details about the effect sizes extracted from each study, or a lack of information about how effect sizes were coded. In the remaining meta-analyses, differences between the reported and reproduced effect size or sample size were common. We discuss a range of possible improvements, such as more clearly indicating which data were used to calculate an effect size, specifying all individual effect sizes, adding detailed information about equations that are used, and how multiple effect size estimates from the same study are combined, but also sharing raw data retrieved from original authors, or unpublished research reports. This project clearly illustrates there is a lot of room for improvement when it comes to the transparency and reproducibility of published meta-analyses.},

However, it is neither logically nor statistically correct to conclude an effect is absent when a hypothesis test is not significant. We present two methods to evaluate the presence or absence of effects: Equivalence testing (based on frequentist statistics) and Bayes factors (based on Bayesian statistics). In four examples from the gerontology literature, we illustrate different ways to specify alternative models that can be used to reject the presence of a meaningful or predicted effect in hypothesis tests. We provide detailed explanations of how to calculate, report, and interpret Bayes factors and equivalence tests. We also discuss how to design informative studies that can provide support for a null model or for the absence of a meaningful effect. The conceptual differences between Bayes factors and equivalence tests are discussed, and we also note when and why they might lead to similar or different inferences in practice. It is important that researchers are able to falsify predictions or can quantify the support for predicted null effects. Bayes factors and equivalence tests provide useful statistical tools to improve inferences about null effects.},

We believe there are two benefits to specifying a hypothesis test in such a way that a computer can evaluate whether the statistical prediction is corroborated or not. First, hypothesis tests become more transparent, falsifiable, and rigorous. Second, scientists benefit if information related to hypothesis tests in scientific articles is easily findable and reusable, for example, to perform meta-analyses, conduct peer review, and examine metascientific research questions. We examine what a machine-readable hypothesis test should look like and demonstrate the feasibility of machine-readable hypothesis tests in a real-life example using the fully operational prototype R package scienceverse.},

When proposing alternatives to p values statisticians often commit the ``statistician's fallacy,'' whereby they declare which statistic researchers really ``want to know.'' Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask. In some situations, the answer to the question they are most interested in will be the p value. As long as null-hypothesis tests have been criticized, researchers have suggested including minimum-effect tests and equivalence tests in our statistical toolbox, and these tests have the potential to greatly improve the questions researchers ask. If anyone believes p values affect the quality of scientific research, preventing the misinterpretation of p values by developing better evidence-based education and user-centered statistical software should be a top priority. Polarized discussions about which statistic scientists should use has distracted us from examining more important questions, such as asking researchers what they want to know when they conduct scientific research. Before we can improve our statistical inferences, we need to improve our statistical questions.},

The results indicate studies examining elderly priming are p-hacked, while studies examining professor priming contain evidential value. I believe a polarized discussion about whether social priming is true or not, whether direct replications or conceptual replications are preferable, or whether methodological rigor or theory development is needed is unlikely to lead to scientific progress.

  abstract = {Background Meta-analyses play an important role in cumulative science by combining information across multiple studies and attempting to provide effect size estimates corrected for publication bias. Research on the reproducibility of meta-analyses reveals that errors are common, and the percentage of effect size calculations that cannot be reproduced is much higher than is desirable. Furthermore, the flexibility in inclusion criteria when performing a meta-analysis, combined with the many conflicting conclusions drawn by meta-analyses of the same set of studies performed by different researchers, has led some people to doubt whether meta-analyses can provide objective conclusions. DiscussionThe present article highlights the need to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses to facilitate the identification of errors, allow researchers to examine the impact of subjective choices such as inclusion criteria, and update the meta-analysis after several years. Reproducibility can be improved by applying standardized reporting guidelines and sharing all meta-analytic data underlying the meta-analysis, including quotes from articles to specify how effect sizes were calculated. Pre-registration of the research protocol (which can be peer-reviewed using novel `registered report' formats) can be used to distinguish a-priori analysis plans from data-driven choices, and reduce the amount of criticism after the results are known. SummaryThe recommendations put forward in this article aim to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses. In addition, they have the benefit of ``future-proofing'' meta-analyses by allowing the shared data to be re-analyzed as new theoretical viewpoints emerge or as novel statistical techniques are developed. Adoption of these practices will lead to increased credibility of meta-analytic conclusions, and facilitate cumulative scientific knowledge.},

While these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a study (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that these statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the meaningful interpretation of results. Type S errors are a response to the criticism of testing against a point null of exactly zero in contexts where true zero effects are implausible. Testing against a minimum-effect, while controlling the Type 1 error rate, provides a more coherent and practically useful alternative. Type M errors warn against effect size inflation after selectively reporting significant results, but we argue that statistical indices such as the critical effect size or bias adjusted effect size are preferable approaches. We do believe that Type S and M errors can be valuable in statistics education where the principles of error control are explained, and in the discussion section of studies that fail to follow good research practices. Overall, we argue their use-cases are more limited than is currently recognized, and alternative solutions deserve greater attention.},

  abstract = {Researchers often rely on analysis of variance (ANOVA) when they report results of experiments. To ensure that a study is adequately powered to yield informative results with an ANOVA, researchers can perform an a priori power analysis. However, power analysis for factorial ANOVA designs is often a challenge. Current software solutions do not allow power analyses for complex designs with several within-participants factors. Moreover, power analyses often need {$\eta$}p{$^2$} or Cohen's f as input, but these effect sizes are not intuitive and do not generalize to different experimental designs. We have created the R package Superpower and online Shiny apps to enable researchers without extensive programming experience to perform simulation-based power analysis for ANOVA designs of up to three within- or between-participants factors. Predicted effects are entered by specifying means, standard deviations, and, for within-participants factors, the correlations.

  abstract = {Researchers often rely on analysis of variance (ANOVA) when they report results of experiments. To ensure that a study is adequately powered to yield informative results with an ANOVA, researchers can perform an a priori power analysis. However, power analysis for factorial ANOVA designs is often a challenge. Current software solutions do not allow power analyses for complex designs with several within-participants factors. Moreover, power analyses often need {$\eta$}2p or Cohen's f as input, but these effect sizes are not intuitive and do not generalize to different experimental designs. We have created the R package Superpower and online Shiny apps to enable researchers without extensive programming experience to perform simulation-based power analysis for ANOVA designs of up to three within- or between-participants factors. Predicted effects are entered by specifying means, standard deviations, and, for within-participants factors, the correlations. The simulation provides the statistical power for all ANOVA main effects, interactions, and individual comparisons. The software can plot power across a range of sample sizes, can control for multiple comparisons, and can compute power when the homogeneity or sphericity assumption is violated.

A principled approach to the use of preregistration should not treat all deviations as problematic. Deviations from a preregistered analysis plan can both reduce and increase the severity of a test, as well as increase the validity of inferences. I provide examples of how researchers can present deviations from preregistrations and evaluate the consequences of the deviation when encountering 1) unforeseen events, 2) errors in the preregistration, 3) missing information, 4) violations of untested assumptions, and 5) falsification of auxiliary hypotheses. The current manuscript aims to provide a principled approach to deciding when to deviate from a preregistration and how to report deviations from an error-statistical philosophy grounded in methodological falsificationism. The goal is to help researchers reflect on the consequence of deviations from preregistrations by evaluating the test's severity and the validity of the inference.},

In multi-factorial repeated measures ANOVA, these calculations can sometimes be cumbersome, especially for higher-order interactions. For designs that only involve factors with two levels each, the paired t test can be used for power calculations, but some pitfalls need to be avoided. In this tutorial, we provide practical advice on how to express main and interaction effects in repeated measures ANOVA as single difference variables. In particular, we demonstrate how to calculate the effect size Cohen's d of this difference variable either based on means, variances, and covariances of conditions or by transforming \$\$\{{\textbackslash}eta \_\{p\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\}\$\$or \$\$\{{\textbackslash}omega \_\{p\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\}\$\$from the ANOVA framework into d. With the effect size correctly specified, we then show how to use the t test for sample size considerations by means of an empirical example. The relevant R code is provided in an online repository for all example calculations covered in this article.},

  abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50~years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

In order to provide empirical evidence on the topic of QRPs, this work presents two linked studies. Study 1 determines the level of use of QRPs based on self-admission rates and estimated prevalence among business scholars in Indonesia. It was determined that if the level of QRP use identified in Study 1 was quite high, Study 2 would be conducted to follow-up on this result, and this was indeed the case. Study 2 examines the factors that encourage and discourage the use of QRPs in the sample analyzed. The main research findings are as follows: (a) in Study 1, we found the self-admission rates and estimated prevalence of business scholars' involvement in QRPs to be quite high when compared with studies conducted in other countries and (b) in Study 2, we found pressure for publication from universities, fear of rejection of manuscripts, meeting the expectations of reviewers, and available rewards to be the main reasons for the use of QRPs in Indonesia, whereas (c) formal sanctions and prevention efforts are factors that discourage QRPs. Recommendations for stakeholders (in this case, reviewers, editors, funders, supervisors, chancellors and others) are also provided in order to reduce the use of QRPs.},

  abstract = {Evidence-based medicine frequently~uses statistical hypothesis testing. In this paradigm, data can only disconfirm a research hypothesis' competitors: One tests the negation of a statistical hypothesis that is supposed to correspond to the research hypothesis. In practice, these hypotheses are often misaligned. For instance, directional research hypotheses are often paired with non-directional statistical hypotheses. Prima facie, one cannot gain proper evidence for one's research hypothesis employing a misaligned statistical hypothesis. This paper sheds lights on the nature of and the reasons for such misalignments and it provides a thorough analysis of whether they pose a threat to evidence-based medicine. The upshots are that the misalignments are often hidden for clinicians and that although some cases of misalignments can be partially counterbalanced, the overall threat is non-negligible. The counterbalances either lead to methodological inadequacy (in addition to the misalignment), loss of statistical power, or involve a (potential) lack of information that could be crucial for decision making. This result casts doubt on various findings of medical studies in addition to issues associated with under-powered studies or the replication crisis.},

The online version of this article has been corrected.] Finkel, Eastwick, and Reis (2016; FER2016) argued the post-2011 methodological reform movement has focused narrowly on replicability, neglecting other essential goals of research. We agree multiple scientific goals are essential, but argue, however, a more fine-grained language, conceptualization, and approach to replication is needed to accomplish these goals. Replication is the general empirical mechanism for testing and falsifying theory. Sufficiently methodologically similar replications, also known as direct replications, test the basic existence of phenomena and ensure cumulative progress is possible a priori. In contrast, increasingly methodologically dissimilar replications, also known as conceptual replications, test the relevance of auxiliary hypotheses (e.g., manipulation and measurement issues, contextual factors) required to productively investigate validity and generalizability. Without prioritizing replicability, a field is not empirically falsifiable. We also disagree with FER2016's position that ``bigger samples are generally better, but . . . that very large samples could have the downside of commandeering resources that would have been better invested in other studies'' (abstract). We identify problematic assumptions involved in FER2016's modifications of our original research-economic model, and present an improved model that quantifies when (and whether) it is reasonable to worry that increasing statistical power will engender potential trade-offs. Sufficiently powering studies (i.e., {$>$}80\%) maximizes both research efficiency and confidence in the literature (research quality). Given that we are in agreement with FER2016 on all key open science points, we are eager to start seeing the accelerated rate of cumulative knowledge development of social psychological phenomena such a sufficiently transparent, powered, and falsifiable approach will generate.

Published research, however, can be useful for theory or application only if it is credible. In science, a credible finding is one that has repeatedly survived risky falsification attempts. However, state-of-the-art meta-analytic approaches cannot determine the credibility of an effect because they do not account for the extent to which each included study has survived such attempted falsification. To overcome this problem, we outline a unified framework for estimating the credibility of published research by examining four fundamental falsifiability-related dimensions: (a) transparency of the methods and data, (b) reproducibility of the results when the same data-processing and analytic decisions are reapplied, (c) robustness of the results to different data-processing and analytic decisions, and (d) replicability of the effect. This framework includes a standardized workflow in which the degree to which a finding has survived scrutiny is quantified along these four facets of credibility. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to published replications in the psychology literature. Finally, we outline a Web implementation of the framework and conclude by encouraging the community of researchers to contribute to the development and crowdsourcing of this platform.},

Within recent psychological articles, research has found an overrepresentation of p values around this cut-off. The present study examined whether this overrepresentation is a product of recent pressure to publish or whether it has existed throughout psychological research. Articles published in 1965 and 2005 from two prominent psychology journals were examined. Like previous research, the frequency of p values at and just below .05 was greater than expected compared to p frequencies in other ranges. While this overrepresentation was found for values published in both 1965 and 2005, it was much greater in 2005. Additionally, p values close to but over .05 were more likely to be rounded down to, or incorrectly reported as, significant in 2005 than in 1965. Modern statistical software and an increased pressure to publish may explain this pattern. The problem may be alleviated by reduced reliance on p values and increased reporting of confidence intervals and effect sizes.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews have become an increasingly popular tool to assess best evidence and have an established place at the top of the evidence pyramid, above individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Most systematic reviews include a meta-analysis. Over recent years, the methodologies employed have become more complex, and we therefore review common methodological pitfalls and new developments in this editorial.Meta-analyses are a `statistical analysis that combines or integrates the results of several independent clinical trials considered by the analyst to be combinable'1 and provides a statistical summary estimate of the effectiveness (called an effect size) of one intervention/treatment vs. another, for a given population.2 However, methods have been advanced to pool results from other study designs, for example, comparative observational studies for estimating an association between a risk factor and disease, or studies for estimating the prevalence of a disease. Meta-analyses are useful as they provide estimates of effect from more than one study and therefore will have increased statistical power (through larger sample size) and have improved estimates of precision (through smaller standard errors), thus yielding narrower confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect estimate; therefore, the more certain we are that the effect estimate reflects the true effect size. Meta-analyses also help to overcome controversies resulting from disparate results across studies and can generate new hypotheses to be tested in future studies. However, there are many decisions which need to be made before a meta-analysis is conducted as part of a systematic review. We describe some of the common pitfalls that authors may face below.},

  abstract = {In clinical trials it is not uncommon to face a multiple testing problem which can have an impact on both type I and type II error rates, leading to inappropriate interpretation of trial results. Multiplicity issues may need to be considered at the design, analysis and interpretation stages of a trial. The proportion of trial reports not adequately correcting for multiple testing remains substantial. The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to multiple testing issues in clinical trials, and to reduce confusion around the need for multiplicity adjustments. We use a tutorial, question-and-answer approach to address the key issues of why, when and how to consider multiplicity adjustments in trials. We summarize the relevant circumstances under which multiplicity adjustments ought to be considered, as well as options for carrying out multiplicity adjustments in terms of trial design factors including Population, Intervention/Comparison, Outcome, Time frame and Analysis (PICOTA). Results are presented in an easy-to-use table and flow diagrams. Confusion about multiplicity issues can be reduced or avoided by considering the potential impact of multiplicity on type I and II errors and, if necessary pre-specifying statistical approaches to either avoid or adjust for multiplicity in the trial protocol or analysis plan.},

Here we argue that unexplained heterogeneity reflects a lack of coherence between the concepts applied and data observed and therefore a lack of understanding of the subject matter. Typical levels of heterogeneity thus offer a useful but neglected perspective on the levels of understanding achieved in psychological science. Focusing on continuous outcome variables, we surveyed heterogeneity in 150 meta-analyses from cognitive, organizational, and social psychology and 57 multiple close replications. Heterogeneity proved to be very high in meta-analyses, with powerful moderators being conspicuously absent. Population effects in the average meta-analysis vary from small to very large for reasons that are typically not understood. In contrast, heterogeneity was moderate in close replications. A newly identified relationship between heterogeneity and effect size allowed us to make predictions about expected heterogeneity levels. We discuss important implications for the formulation and evaluation of theories in psychology. On the basis of insights from the history and philosophy of science, we argue that the reduction of heterogeneity is important for progress in psychology and its practical applications, and we suggest changes to our collective research practice toward this end.},

  abstract = {Psychological scientists strive to advance understanding of how and why we animals do and think and feel as we do. This is difficult, in part because flukes of chance and measurement error obscure researchers' perceptions. Many psychologists use inferential statistical tests to peer through the murk of chance and discern relationships between variables. Those tests are powerful tools, but they must be wielded with skill. Moreover, research reports must convey to readers a detailed and accurate understanding of how the data were obtained and analyzed. Research psychologists often fall short in those regards. This paper attempts to motivate and explain ways to enhance the transparency and replicability of psychological science. Specifically, I speak to how publication bias and p hacking contribute to effect-size exaggeration in the published literature and how effect-size exaggeration contributes, in turn, to replication failures. Then I present seven steps toward addressing these problems: telling the truth; upgrading statistical knowledge; standardizing aspects of research practices; documenting laboratory procedures in a laboratory manual; making materials, data, and analysis scripts transparent; addressing constraints on generality; and collaborating.

  abstract = {Publication bias is a serious problem in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which can affect the validity and generalization of conclusions. Currently, approaches to dealing with publication bias can be distinguished into two classes: selection models and funnel-plot-based methods. Selection models use weight functions to adjust the overall effect size estimate and are usually employed as sensitivity analyses to assess the potential impact of publication bias. Funnel-plot-based methods include visual examination of a funnel plot, regression and rank tests, and the nonparametric trim and fill method. Although these approaches have been widely used in applications, measures for quantifying publication bias are seldom studied in the literature. Such measures can be used as a characteristic of a meta-analysis; also, they permit comparisons of publication biases between different meta-analyses. Egger's regression intercept may be considered as a candidate measure, but it lacks an intuitive interpretation. This article introduces a new measure, the skewness of the standardized deviates, to quantify publication bias. This measure describes the asymmetry of the collected studies' distribution. In addition, a new test for publication bias is derived based on the skewness. Large sample properties of the new measure are studied, and its performance is illustrated using simulations and three case studies.},

Moreover, the effects are not so small that they can be dismissed as lacking practical or clinical significance.

Furthermore, reproducible meta-analyses can be easily updated with new data and reanalysed applying new and more refined analysis techniques. We attempted to empirically assess the prevalence of transparency and reproducibility-related reporting practices in published meta-analyses from clinical psychology by examining a random sample of 100 meta-analyses. Our purpose was to identify the key points that could be improved, with the aim of providing some recommendations for carrying out reproducible meta-analyses. We conducted a meta-review of meta-analyses of psychological interventions published between 2000 and 2020. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science databases. A structured coding form to assess transparency indicators was created based on previous studies and existing meta-analysis guidelines. We found major issues concerning: completely reproducible search procedures report, specification of the exact method to compute effect sizes, choice of weighting factors and estimators, lack of availability of the raw statistics used to compute the effect size and of interoperability of available data, and practically total absence of analysis script code sharing. Based on our findings, we conclude with recommendations intended to improve the transparency, openness, and reproducibility-related reporting practices of meta-analyses in clinical psychology and related areas.},

Reproducibility of scientific results could be considered as the minimal threshold of this credibility. We assessed the reproducibility of a sample of meta-analyses published between 2000 and 2020. From a random sample of 100 articles reporting results of meta-analyses of interventions in clinical psychology, 217 meta-analyses were selected. We first tried to retrieve the original data by recovering a data file, recoding the data from document files, or requesting it from original authors. Second, through a multistage workflow, we tried to reproduce the main results of each meta-analysis. The original data were retrieved for 67\% (146/217) of meta-analyses. Although this rate showed an improvement over the years, in only 5\% of these cases was it possible to retrieve a data file ready for reuse. Of these 146, 52 showed a discrepancy larger than 5\% in the main results in the first stage. For 10 meta-analyses, this discrepancy was solved after fixing a coding error of our data-retrieval process, and for 15 of them, it was considered approximately reproduced in a qualitative assessment. In the remaining meta-analyses (18\%, 27/146), different issues were identified in an in-depth review, such as reporting inconsistencies, lack of data, or transcription errors. Nevertheless, the numerical discrepancies were mostly minor and had little or no impact on the conclusions. Overall, one of the biggest threats to the reproducibility of meta-analysis is related to data availability and current data-sharing practices in meta-analysis.},

  abstract = {Cognitive functions are essential in any form of exercise. Recently, interest has mounted in addressing the relationship between caffeine intake and cognitive  performance during sports practice. This review examines this relationship  through a structured search of the databases Medline/PubMed and Web of Science  for relevant articles published in English from August 1999 to March 2020. The  study followed PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria were defined according to  the PICOS model. The identified records reported on randomized cross-over studies  in which caffeine intake (as drinks, capsules, energy bars, or gum) was compared  to an identical placebo situation. There were no filters on participants'  training level, gender, or age. For the systematic review, 13 studies examining  the impacts of caffeine on objective measures of cognitive performance or  self-reported cognitive performance were selected. Five of these studies were  also subjected to meta-analysis. After pooling data in the meta-analysis, the  significant impacts of caffeine only emerged on attention, accuracy, and speed.  The results of the 13 studies, nevertheless, suggest that the intake of a  low/moderate dose of caffeine before and/or during exercise can improve  self-reported energy, mood, and cognitive functions, such as attention; it may  also improve simple reaction time, choice reaction time, memory, or fatigue,  however, this may depend on the research protocols.},

The estimand is the target quantity---the purpose of the statistical analysis. Much attention is already placed on how to do estimation; a similar degree of care should be given to defining the thing we are estimating. We advocate that authors state the central quantity of each analysis---the theoretical estimand---in precise terms that exist outside of any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand, which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding precise estimands to research practice expands the space of theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation. By grounding all three steps in a precise statement of the target quantity, our framework connects statistical evidence to theory.},

Results showed that almost half (k = 224) of all sampled primary effect sizes could not be reproduced based on the reported information in the meta-analysis, mostly because of incomplete or missing information on how effect sizes from primary studies were selected and computed. Overall, this led to small discrepancies in the computation of mean effect sizes, confidence intervals and heterogeneity estimates in 13 out of 33 meta-analyses.

For example, although publication is a critical element in determining the contribution and impact of scientific findings, little research attention has been devoted to the variables operative in journal review policies. In the present study, 75 journal reviewers were asked to referee manuscripts which described identical experimental procedures but which reported positive, negative, mixed, or no results. In addition to showing poor interrater agreement, reviewers were strongly biased against manuscripts which reported results contrary to their theoretical perspective. The implications of these findings for epistemology and the peer review system are briefly addressed.},

First, decisions based on data can be made more efficiently by choosing an alpha level that minimizes the combined Type 1 and Type 2 error rate. Second, it is possible that in studies with very high statistical power, p values lower than the alpha level can be more likely when the null hypothesis is true than when the alternative hypothesis is true (i.e., Lindley's paradox). In this article, we explain two approaches that can be used to justify a better choice of an alpha level than relying on the default threshold of .05. The first approach is based on the idea to either minimize or balance Type 1 and Type 2 error rates. The second approach lowers the alpha level as a function of the sample size to prevent Lindley's paradox. An R package and Shiny app are provided to perform the required calculations. Both approaches have their limitations (e.g., the challenge of specifying relative costs and priors) but can offer an improvement to current practices, especially when sample sizes are large. The use of alpha levels that are better justified should improve statistical inferences and can increase the efficiency and informativeness of scientific research.},

In order to test and adjust for publication bias, we extend model-averaged Bayesian meta-analysis with selection models. The resulting robust Bayesian meta-analysis (RoBMA) methodology does not require all-or-none decisions about the presence of publication bias, can quantify evidence in favor of the absence of publication bias, and performs well under high heterogeneity. By model-averaging over a set of 12 models, RoBMA is relatively robust to model misspecification and simulations show that it outperforms existing methods. We demonstrate that RoBMA finds evidence for the absence of publication bias in Registered Replication Reports and reliably avoids false positives. We provide an implementation in R so that researchers can easily use the new methodology in practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

Classical methods based on the funnel plot, including Egger's test and Trim-and-Fill, have become the de facto default methods to do so, with a large majority of recent meta-analyses in top medical journals (85\%) assessing for publication bias exclusively using these methods. However, these classical funnel plot methods have important limitations when used as the sole means of assessing publication bias: they essentially assume that the publication process favors large point estimates for small studies and does not affect the largest studies, and they can perform poorly when effects are heterogeneous. In light of these limitations, we recommend that meta-analyses routinely apply other publication bias methods in addition to or instead of classical funnel plot methods. To this end, we describe how to use and interpret selection models. These methods make the often more realistic assumption that publication bias favors ``statistically significant'' results, and the methods also directly accommodate effect heterogeneity. Selection models have been established for decades in the statistics literature and are supported by user-friendly software, yet remain rarely reported in many disciplines. We use a previously published meta-analysis to demonstrate that selection models can yield insights that extend beyond those provided by funnel plot methods, suggesting the importance of establishing more comprehensive reporting practices for publication bias assessment.},

Undeserved authorship was perceived by all groups as the most prevalent detrimental research practice, while fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, and not citing prior relevant research, were seen as more prevalent by editors than authors or reviewers. Overall, 20\% of respondents admitted sacrificing the quality of their publications for quantity, and 14\% reported that funders interfered in their study design or reporting. While survey respondents came from 126 different countries, due to the survey's overall low response rate our results might not necessarily be generalizable.

We review a number of sensitivity analysis methods to do so, especially recent developments that are straightforward to implement and interpret and that use somewhat less stringent statistical assumptions than do earlier methods. We give recommendations for how these newer methods could be applied in practice and illustrate using a previously published meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses can provide informative quantitative summaries of evidence strength, and we suggest reporting them routinely in meta-analyses of potentially biased studies. This recommendation in no way diminishes the importance of defining study eligibility criteria that reduce bias and of characterizing studies' risks of bias qualitatively.},

A total of 32 well-trained collegiate sprinters and jumpers performed countermovement jumps and squat jumps three times each in a double-blind, counterbalanced, randomized, crossover design. Participants ingested a placebo or 1, 3, or 6~mg/kg caffeine 60~min before jumping. Compared with the placebo, 6~mg/kg caffeine significantly enhanced countermovement jump (p {$<$} .001) and squat jump (p = .012) heights; furthermore, 1 and 3~mg/kg of caffeine also significantly increased countermovement jump height (1~mg/kg: p = .002, 3~mg/kg: p {$<$} .001) but not squat jump height (1~mg/kg: p = .436, 3~mg/kg: p = .054). There were no significant differences among all caffeine doses in both jumps (all p {$>$} .05). In conclusion, even at a dose as low as 1~mg/kg, caffeine improved vertical jump performance in a dose-independent manner. This study provides new insight into the applicability and feasibility of 1~mg/kg caffeine as a safe and effective ergogenic strategy for jump performance.},

  abstract = {Nutrition usually makes a small but potentially valuable contribution to successful performance in elite athletes, and dietary supplements can make a minor contribution to this nutrition programme. Nonetheless, supplement use is widespread at all levels of sport. Products described as supplements target different issues, including (1) the management of micronutrient deficiencies, (2) supply of convenient forms of energy and macronutrients, and (3) provision of direct benefits to performance or (4) indirect benefits such as supporting intense training regimens. The appropriate use of some supplements can benefit the athlete, but others may harm the athlete's health, performance, and/or livelihood and reputation (if an antidoping rule violation results). A complete nutritional assessment should be undertaken before decisions regarding supplement use are made. Supplements claiming to directly or indirectly enhance performance are typically the largest group of products marketed to athletes, but only a few (including caffeine, creatine, specific buffering agents and nitrate) have good evidence of benefits. However, responses are affected by the scenario of use and may vary widely between individuals because of factors that include genetics, the microbiome and habitual diet. Supplements intended to enhance performance should be thoroughly trialled in training or simulated competition before being used in competition. Inadvertent ingestion of substances prohibited under the antidoping codes that govern elite sport is a known risk of taking some supplements. Protection of the athlete's health and awareness of the potential for harm must be paramount; expert professional opinion and assistance is strongly advised before an athlete embarks on supplement use.},

The "curse of multiplicities" plays a central role in the presentation. Most psychologists realize that testing multiple hypotheses in a single study affects the Type I error rate, but corresponding implications for power have largely been ignored. The presence of multiple hypothesis tests leads to 3 different conceptualizations of power. Implications of these 3 conceptualizations are discussed from the perspective of the individual researcher and from the perspective of developing a coherent literature. Supplementing significance tests with effect size measures and confidence intervals is shown to address some but not necessarily all problems associated with multiple testing.

Often, the first study showed a statistically significant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the first study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology's alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.},

Both current and long-standing problems of N-P tests stem from unclarity and confusion, even among N-P adherents, as to how a test's (pre-data) error probabilities are to be used for (post-data) inductive inference as opposed to inductive behavior. We argue that the relevance of error probabilities is to ensure that only statistical hypotheses that have passed severe or probative tests are inferred from the data. The severity criterion supplies a meta-statistical principle for evaluating proposed statistical inferences, avoiding classic fallacies from tests that are overly sensitive, as well as those not sensitive enough to particular errors and discrepancies.}

Initially, we briefly describe the most common approaches, along with their rationale, to investigate the effects of different interventions. We then discuss the main steps involved in the design and analysis of equivalence and non-inferiority studies, commonly performed in other research fields, with worked examples from exercise physiology and sport science scenarios. Finally, we provide recommendations to exercise physiologists and sport scientists who would like to apply the different approaches in future research.

  abstract = {Acute ketone monoester (KE) supplementation can alter exercise responses, but the performance effect is unclear. The limited and equivocal data to date are likely related to factors including the KE dose, test conditions, and caliber of athletes studied. We tested the hypothesis that mean power output during a 20-min cycling time trial (TT) would be different after KE ingestion compared to a placebo (PL). A sample size of 22 was estimated to provide 80\% power to detect an effect size dz of 0.63 at an alpha level of .05 with a two-tailed paired t test. This determination considered 2.0\% as the minimal important difference in performance. Twenty-three trained cyclists (N\,=\,23; peak oxygen uptake: 65\,{\textpm}\,12 ml{$\cdot$}kg-1 min-1; M\,{\textpm}\,SD), who were regularly cycling {$>$}5 hr/week, completed a familiarization trial followed by two experimental trials. Participants self-selected and replicated their diet and exercise for {$\sim$}24 hr before each trial. Participants ingested either 0.35 g/kg body mass of (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate KE or a flavor-matched PL 30 min before exercise in a randomized, triple-blind, crossover manner. Exercise involved a 15-min warm-up followed by the 20-min TT on a cycle ergometer. The only feedback provided was time elapsed. Preexercise venous [{$\beta$}-hydroxybutyrate] was higher after KE versus PL (2.0\,{\textpm}\,0.6 vs. 0.2\,{\textpm}\,0.1 mM, p\,{$<$}\,.0001). Mean TT power output was 2.4\% (0.6\% to 4.1\%; mean [95\% confidence interval]) lower after KE versus PL (255\,{\textpm}\,54 vs. 261\,{\textpm}\,54 W, p\,{$<$}\,.01; dz\,=\,0.60). The mechanistic basis for the impaired TT performance after KE ingestion under the present study conditions remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Throughout the sport-science and sports-medicine literature, the term "elite" subjects might be one of the most overused and ill-defined terms. Currently, there is no common perspective or terminology to characterize the caliber and training status of an individual or cohort. This paper presents a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework whereby all individuals across a spectrum of exercise backgrounds and athletic abilities can be classified. The Participant Classification Framework uses training volume and performance metrics to classify a participant to one of the following: Tier 0: Sedentary; Tier 1: Recreationally Active; Tier 2: Trained/Developmental; Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level; Tier 4: Elite/International Level; or Tier 5: World Class. We suggest the Participant Classification Framework can be used to classify participants both prospectively (as part of study participant recruitment) and retrospectively (during systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses). Discussion around how the Participant Classification Framework can be tailored toward different sports, athletes, and/or events has occurred, and sport-specific examples provided. Additional nuances such as depth of sport participation, nationality differences, and gender parity within a sport are all discussed. Finally, chronological age with reference to the junior and masters athlete, as well as the Paralympic athlete, and their inclusion within the Participant Classification Framework has also been considered. It is our intention that this framework be widely implemented to systematically classify participants in research featuring exercise, sport, performance, health, and/or fitness outcomes going forward, providing the much-needed uniformity to classification practices.},

  abstract = {Evidence has ostensibly been accumulating over the past 2 decades suggesting that an external focus on the intended movement effect (e.g., on the golf club during a swing) is superior to an internal focus on body movements (e.g., on your arms during a swing) for skill acquisition. Seven previous meta-studies have all reported evidence of external focus superiority. The most comprehensive of these concluded that an external focus enhances motor skill retention, transfer, and performance and leads to reduced eletromyographic activity during performance and that more distal external foci are superior to proximal external foci for performance. Here, we reanalyzed these data using robust Bayesian meta-analyses that included several plausible models of publication bias. We found moderate to strong evidence of publication bias for all analyses. After correcting for publication bias, estimated mean effects were negligible: g = 0.01 (performance), g = 0.15 (retention), g = 0.09 (transfer), g = 0.06 (electromyography), and g = -0.01 (distance effect). Bayes factors indicated data favored the null for each analysis, ranging from BF01 = 1.3 (retention) to 5.75 (performance). We found clear evidence of heterogeneity in each analysis, suggesting the impact of attentional focus depends on yet unknown contextual factors. Our results contradict the existing consensus that an external focus is always more effective than an internal focus. Instead, focus of attention appears to have a variety of effects that we cannot account for, and, on average, those effects are small to nil. These results parallel previous metascience suggesting publication bias has obfuscated the motor learning literature. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)},

Cognitive fatigue is claimed to affect subsequent physical performance by inducing energy depletion in the brain, depletion of brain catecholamine neurotransmitters or changes in motivation. Observation of the psychophysiology and neurochemistry literature questions the ability of 90\,min' cognitive activity to deplete energy or catecholamine resources. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the evidence for cognitive fatigue having an effect on subsequent physical performance. A systematic, meta-analytic review was undertaken. We found a small but significant pooled effect size based on comparison between physical performance post-cognitive fatigue compared to post-control (g\,=\,-0.27, SE\,=\,-0.12, 95\% CI -0.49 to -0.04, Z(10)\,=\,-2.283, p\,{$<$}\,0.05). However, the results were not heterogenous (Q(10)\,=\,2.789, p\,{$>$}\,0.10, {$T$}2\,{$<$}\,0.001), suggesting that the pooled effect size does not amount to a real effect and differences are due to random error. No publication bias was evident (Kendall's {$\tau$}\,=\,-0.07, p\,{$>$}\,0.05). Thus, the results are somewhat contradictory. The pooled effect size shows a small but significant negative effect of cognitive fatigue, however tests of heterogeneity show that the results are due to random error. Future research should use neuroscientific tests to ensure that cognitive fatigue has been achieved.},

We find that the p-curve and p-uniform approaches perform reasonably well but not as well as the original Hedges approach in the restrictive setting for which all three were designed. We also find they perform poorly in more realistic settings, whereas variants of the Hedges approach perform well. We conclude by urging caution in the application of selection methods: Given the idealistic model assumptions underlying selection methods and the sensitivity of population average effect size estimates to them, we advocate that selection methods should be used less for obtaining a single estimate that purports to adjust for publication bias ex post and more for sensitivity analysis?that is, exploring the range of estimates that result from assuming different forms of and severity of publication bias.},

  abstract = {Replication is complicated in psychological research because studies of a given psychological phenomenon can never be direct or exact replications of one another, and thus effect sizes vary from one study of the phenomenon to the next---an issue of clear importance for replication. Current large-scale replication projects represent an important step forward for assessing replicability, but provide only limited information because they have thus far been designed in a manner such that heterogeneity either cannot be assessed or is intended to be eliminated. Consequently, the nontrivial degree of heterogeneity found in these projects represents a lower bound on the true degree of heterogeneity. We recommend enriching large-scale replication projects going forward by embracing heterogeneity. We argue this is the key for assessing replicability: if effect sizes are sufficiently heterogeneous---even if the sign of the effect is consistent---the phenomenon in question does not seem particularly replicable and the theory underlying it seems poorly constructed and in need of enrichment. Uncovering why and revising theory in light of it will lead to improved theory that explains heterogeneity and increases replicability. Given this, large-scale replication projects can play an important role not only in assessing replicability but also in advancing theory.},

However, effect sizes are rarely fixed in psychological research: Study design choices, such as the operationalization of the dependent variable or the treatment manipulation, the social context, the subject pool, or the time of day, typically cause systematic variation in the effect size. Ignoring this between-study variation, as standard power formulae do, results in assessments of power that are too optimistic. Consequently, when researchers attempting replication set sample sizes using these formulae, their studies will be underpowered and will thus fail at a greater than expected rate. We illustrate this with both hypothetical examples and data on several well-studied phenomena in psychology. We provide formulae that account for between-study variation and suggest that researchers set sample sizes with respect to our generally more conservative formulae. Our formulae generalize to settings in which there are multiple effects of interest. We also introduce an easy-to-use website that implements our approach to setting sample sizes. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for quantifying between-study variation.},

In psychology, the directional counternull of interest, H*, is not equivalent to the substantive theory T, there being many plausible alternative explanations of a mere directional trend (weak use of significance tests). Testing against a predicted point value (the strong use of significant tests) can discorroborate T by refuting H*. If used thus to abandon T forthwith, it is too strong, not allowing for theoretical verisimilitude as distinguished from truth. Defense and amendment of an apparently falsified T are appropriate strategies only when T has accumulated a good track record ("money in the bank") by making successful or near-miss predictions of low prior probability (Salmon's "damn strange coincidences"). Two rough indexes are proposed for numerifying the track record, by considering jointly how intolerant (risky) and how close (accurate) are its predictions.}

Even though intrinsic subject matter difficulties (20 are listed) contribute to this, the excessive reliance on significance testing is partly responsible (Ronald A. Fisher). Karl Popper's approach, with modifications, would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of "significant differences" are little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions. Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values ("consistency tests") are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, 2nd-order differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94\% success with no false negatives.

In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching 1/2 of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by "success" is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. "Statistical significance" plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental "cuteness" and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.}

In a larger sample of 174 studies, we also examined a) the usage, reporting practices and reproducibility of a-priori power analyses; and b) the prevalence of reporting practices of t-statistic or F-ratio, degrees of freedom, exact p-values, effect sizes and confidence intervals. Our results indicate that there was some indication of publication bias and the average observed power was low (53\% for significant and non-significant findings and 61\% for only significant findings).

These replication projects revealed that a significant portion of original study findings could not be replicated, giving rise to the conceptualization of the replication crisis. Although previous research in the field of sports and exercise science has identified the first warning signs, such as an overwhelming proportion of significant findings, small sample sizes and lack of data availability, their possible consequences for the replicability of our field have been overlooked.

I argue that this seemingly fundamental question can be interpreted in two very different ways and that its answer is, in practice, virtually unknowable under either interpretation. Although the data from an initial experiment can be used to estimate one type of replication probability, this estimate will rarely be precise enough to be of any use. The other type of replication probability is also unknowable, because it depends on unknown aspects of the research context. Thus, although it would be nice to know the probability of replicating a significant effect, researchers must accept the fact that they generally cannot determine this information, whichever type of replication probability they seek.},

  abstract = {While the modern science is characterized by an exponential growth in scientific literature, the increase in publication volume clearly does not reflect the expansion of the cognitive boundaries of science. Nevertheless, most of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science or for making funding and policy decisions are based on productivity. Similarly, the increasing level of knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy greater visibility, does not necessarily mean that ``big science'' leads to cognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles published over 60--130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve {$<$}1\% precision. We show that the periods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in publication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries of science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of the cognitive territory can also be applied to study many other aspects of `science of science.'},

Traditionally, journals have been ranked by peer review lists such as that of the Association of Business Schools (UK) or though their journal impact factor (JIF). However, several new indicators have been developed, such as the h-index, SJR, SNIP and the Eigenfactor which take into account different factors and therefore have their own particular biases. In this paper we evaluate these metrics both theoretically and also through an empirical study of a large set of business and management journals. We show that even though the indicators appear highly correlated in fact they lead to large differences in journal rankings. We contextualise our results in terms of the UK's large scale research assessment exercise (the RAE/REF) and particularly the ABS journal ranking list. We conclude that no one indicator is superior but that the h-index (which includes the productivity of a journal) and SNIP (which aims to normalise for field effects) may be the most effective at the moment.},

Both the expected probability to publish in Q1 journals, given by the number of papers published in each quartile, as well as the average citations received by Q1 publications compared to other quartiles, is largely dependent on the research area. This study analyzes the share of articles published in each quartile in the 25 largest research areas indexed by Science Citation Index-Expanded (Web of Science) and their main citation characteristics aiming to enrich the discussion about journal-based evaluation systems and specifically the number and/or the share of publications in Q1. It was found that the average share of documents published in Q1 was 45.7\% (38.4\% for articles and reviews), varying from 25.4 to 85.6\% (from 17.1 to 88.9\% for articles and reviews) depending on the area. Q1 publications were cited, on average, 2.07 times more than Q2 publications (2.41 times for articles plus reviews), however, depending on the area, this ratio varied from 0.9 to 6.1 (from 1.7 to 5.4 times for articles plus reviews). Q1 (total publications or articles plus reviews), received, on average, 65\% of total citations of the research area, but again this value varied from 46 to 98\% depending on the area.},

A simulation study is performed, and the fixed and random effect estimates of the three methods are compared with each other. Both the robust variance estimation and three-level approach result in unbiased estimates of the fixed effects, corresponding standard errors and variances. Averaging effect sizes results in overestimated standard errors when the effect sizes within studies are truly independent. Although the robust variance and three-level approach are more complicated to use, they have the advantage that they do not require an estimate of the correlation between outcomes, and they still result in unbiased parameter estimates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the effects of cold-water immersion (CWI) on the recovery of athletic performance, perceptual measures and creatine kinase  (CK) have reported mixed results in physically active populations. OBJECTIVES:  The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of CWI on  recovery of athletic performance, perceptual measures and CK following an acute  bout of exercise in physically active populations. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic  review with meta-analysis and meta-regression. METHODS: A systematic search was  conducted in September 2021 using Medline, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science,  Cochrane Library, EmCare and Embase databases. Studies were included if they were  peer reviewed and published in English, included participants who were involved  in sport or deemed physically active, compared CWI with passive recovery methods  following an acute bout of strenuous exercise and included athletic performance,  athlete perception and CK outcome measures. Studies were divided into two  strenuous exercise subgroups: eccentric exercise and high-intensity exercise.  Random effects meta-analyses were used to determine standardised mean differences  (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals. Meta-regression analyses were completed with  water temperature and exposure durations as continuous moderator variables.  RESULTS: Fifty-two studies were included in the meta-analyses. CWI improved the  recovery of muscular power 24~h after eccentric exercise (SMD 0.34 [95\% CI  0.06-0.62]) and after high-intensity exercise (SMD 0.22 [95\% CI 0.004-0.43]), and  reduced serum CK (SMD\,-\,0.85 [95\% CI\,-\,1.61 to\,-\,0.08]) 24~h after high-intensity  exercise. CWI also improved muscle soreness (SMD\,-\,0.89 [95\% CI\,-\,1.48  to\,-\,0.29]) and perceived feelings of recovery (SMD 0.66 [95\% CI 0.29-1.03]) 24~h  after high-intensity exercise. There was no significant influence on the recovery  of strength performance following either eccentric or high-intensity exercise.  Meta-regression indicated that shorter time and lower temperatures were related  to the largest beneficial effects on serum CK (duration and temperature dose  effects) and endurance performance (duration dose effects only) after  high-intensity exercise. CONCLUSION: CWI was an effective recovery tool after  high-intensity exercise, with positive outcomes occurring for muscular power,  muscle soreness, CK, and perceived recovery 24~h after exercise. However, after  eccentric exercise, CWI was only effective for positively influencing muscular  power 24~h after exercise. Dose-response relationships emerged for positively  influencing endurance performance and reducing serum CK, indicating that shorter  durations and lower temperatures may improve the efficacy of CWI if used after  high-intensity exercise.

We review two historical examples in which statistical evidence was used to accept a simplifying assumption (that there is no luminiferous ether and that genetic traits are passed on in discrete forms) and one in which the null hypothesis was not accepted despite repeated failures (gravitational waves), drawing lessons from each. We emphasize the role of the scientific context in acceptance of the null: Accepting a null hypothesis is never a purely statistical affair.},

Despite research on the prevalence of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs) and the replicability of particular findings, the impact of the current discussion on research practices is unknown. The current studies examine whether and how practices have changed, if at all, over the last 10 years. In Study 1, we surveyed 1,166 social and personality psychologists about how the current debate has affected their perceptions of their own and the field's research practices. In Study 2, we coded the research practices and critical test statistics from social and personality psychology articles published in 2003-2004 and 2013-2014. Together, these studies suggest that (a) perceptions of the current state of the field are more pessimistic than optimistic; (b) the discussion has increased researchers' intentions to avoid QRPs and adopt proposed best practices, (c) the estimated replicability of research published in 2003-2004 may not be as bad as many feared, and (d) research published in 2013-2014 shows some improvement over research published in 2003-2004, a result that suggests the field is evolving in a positive direction.

  abstract = {Improving the reliability and efficiency of scientific research will increase the credibility of the published scientific literature and accelerate discovery. Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a summary-statistics-based power analysis---a practical method for conducting power analysis for mixed-effects modeling with two-level nested data (for both binary and continuous predictors), complementing the existing formula-based and simulation-based methods. The proposed method bases its logic on conditional equivalence of the summary-statistics approach and mixed-effects modeling, paring back the power analysis for mixed-effects modeling to that for a simpler statistical analysis (e.g., one-sample t test). Accordingly, the proposed method allows us to conduct power analysis for mixed-effects modeling using popular software such as G*Power or the pwr package in R and, with minimum input from relevant prior work (e.g., t value). We provide analytic proof and a series of statistical simulations to show the validity and robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis and show illustrative examples with real published work. We also developed a web app (https://koumurayama.shinyapps.io/summary\_statistics\_based\_power/) to facilitate the utility of the proposed method. While the proposed method has limited flexibilities compared with the existing methods in terms of the models and designs that can be appropriately handled, it provides a convenient alternative for applied researchers when there is limited information to conduct power analysis.

However, this issue's exact prevalence remains unclear, as does whether this issue is getting better or worse. In this pre-registered study, we sought to answer these questions by examining the discussion sections of 599 articles published across 10 psychology journals and three time points (2009, 2015 and 2021), and coding whether a nonsignificant finding was interpreted in such a way as to suggest the effect does not exist. Our models indicate that between 76\% and 85\% of psychology articles published between 2009 and 2021 that discussed a nonsignificant finding misinterpreted nonsignificance as reflecting no effect. It is likely between 54\% and 62\% of articles over this time period claimed explicitly that this meant no effect on the population of interest. Our findings also indicate that only between 4\% and 8\% of articles explicitly discussed the possibility that the nonsignificant effect may exist but could not be found. Differences in prevalence rates over time were nonsignificant. Collectively, our findings indicate this interpretative error is a major problem in psychology. We call on stakeholders with an interest in improving psychological science to prioritize tackling it.},

  abstract = {Publication bias threatens the validity of quantitative evidence from meta-analyses as it results in some findings being overrepresented in meta-analytic datasets because they are published more frequently or sooner (e.g. `positive' results). Unfortunately, methods to test for the presence of publication bias, or assess its impact on meta-analytic results, are unsuitable for datasets with high heterogeneity and non-independence, as is common in ecology and evolutionary biology. We first review both classic and emerging publication bias tests (e.g. funnel plots, Egger's regression, cumulative meta-analysis, fail-safe N, trim-and-fill tests, p-curve and selection models), showing that some tests cannot handle heterogeneity, and, more importantly, none of the methods can deal with non-independence. For each method, we estimate current usage in ecology and evolutionary biology, based on a representative sample of 102 meta-analyses published in the last 10 years. Then, we propose a new method using multilevel meta-regression, which can model both heterogeneity and non-independence, by extending existing regression-based methods (i.e. Egger's regression). We describe how our multilevel meta-regression can test not only publication bias, but also time-lag bias, and how it can be supplemented by residual funnel plots. Overall, we provide ecologists and evolutionary biologists with practical recommendations on which methods are appropriate to employ given independent and non-independent effect sizes. No method is ideal, and more simulation studies are required to understand how Type 1 and Type 2 error rates are impacted by complex data structures. Still, the limitations of these methods do not justify ignoring publication bias in ecological and evolutionary meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis is a quantitative way of synthesizing results from multiple studies to obtain reliable evidence of an intervention or phenomenon. Indeed, an increasing number of meta-analyses are conducted in environmental sciences, and resulting meta-analytic evidence is often used in environmental policies and decision-making. We conducted a survey of recent meta-analyses in environmental sciences and found poor standards of current meta-analytic practice and reporting. For example, only\,{\textasciitilde}\,40\% of the 73 reviewed meta-analyses reported heterogeneity (variation among effect sizes beyond sampling error), and publication bias was assessed in fewer than half. Furthermore, although almost all the meta-analyses had multiple effect sizes originating from the same studies, non-independence among effect sizes was considered in only half of the meta-analyses. To improve the implementation of meta-analysis in environmental sciences, we here outline practical guidance for conducting a meta-analysis in environmental sciences. We describe the key concepts of effect size and meta-analysis and detail procedures for fitting multilevel meta-analysis and meta-regression models and performing associated publication bias tests. We demonstrate a clear need for environmental scientists to embrace multilevel meta-analytic models, which explicitly model dependence among effect sizes, rather than the commonly used random-effects models. Further, we discuss how reporting and visual presentations of meta-analytic results can be much improved by following reporting guidelines such as PRISMA-EcoEvo (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). This paper, along with the accompanying online tutorial, serves as a practical guide on conducting a complete set of meta-analytic procedures (i.e., meta-analysis, heterogeneity quantification, meta-regression, publication bias tests and sensitivity analysis) and also as a gateway to more advanced, yet appropriate, methods.},

When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery. Concerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research. Reproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.},

  abstract = {Scientific research has evolved from an activity mainly undertaken by individuals operating in a few locations to many teams, large communities, and complex organizations involving hundreds to thousands of individuals worldwide. In the 17th century, scientists would communicate through letters and were able to understand and assimilate major developments across all the emerging major disciplines. In 2016---the most recent year for which data are available---more than 2,295,000 scientific and engineering research articles were published worldwide (National Science Foundation, 2018e). In addition, the number of scientific and engineering fields and subfields of research is large and has greatly expanded in recent years, especially in fields that intersect disciplines (e.g., biophysics); more than 230 distinct fields and subfields can now be identified. The published literature is so voluminous and specialized that some researchers look to information retrieval, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to track and apprehend the important work in their own fields.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In sport and exercise, warm-ups induce various physiological changes that facilitate subsequent performance. We have shown that delivering patterned stimulation to cutaneous afferents during sprint cycling mitigates fatigue-related decrements in performance, and that repeated sensory stimulation amplifies spinal reflex excitability. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether sensory enhancement of warm-up would affect subsequent high-intensity arm cycling performance. METHODS: Participants completed three experimental sessions, in which they randomly performed either a control, stim, or sleeve warm-up condition prior to maximal duration arm cycling. During the control condition, warmup consisted of low-intensity arm cycling for 15~min. The stim condition was the same, except they received alternating pulses (400~ms, 50~Hz) of stimulation just above their perceptual threshold to the wrists during warm-up. The third condition required participants to wear custom fabricated compression sleeves around the elbow during warm-up. Grip strength and spinal reflex excitability were measured before and after each warm-up and fatigue protocol, which required participants to arm cycle at 85\% of peak power output until they reached volitional fatigue. Peak power output was determined during an incremental test at minimum 72~h prior to the first session. RESULTS: Both sensory enhanced warm-up conditions amplified subsequent high-intensity arm cycling performance by\,{\textasciitilde}\,30\%. Additionally, the stim and sleeve warm-up conditions yielded improvements in grip strength (increased by\,{\textasciitilde}\,5\%) immediately after the sensory enhanced warm-ups. Ergogenic benefits from the sensory enhanced warm-up conditions did not differ between one another. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that enhanced sensory input during warm-up can elicit improvements in both maximal and submaximal performance measures.},

  abstract = {The problem of testing statistical hypotheses is an old one. Its origin is usually connected with the name of Thomas Bayes, who gave the well-known theorem on the probabilities a posteriori of the possible ``causes" of a given event. Since then it has been discussed by many writers of whom we shall here mention two only, Bertrand and Borel, whose differing views serve well to illustrate the point from which we shall approach the subject. Bertrand put into statistical form a variety of hypotheses, as for example the hypothesis that a given group of stars with relatively small angular distances between them as seen from the earth, form a ``system'' or group in space. His method of attack, which is that in common use, consisted essentially in calculating the probability, P, that a certain character, x, of the observed facts would arise if the hypothesis tested were true. If P were very small, this would generally be considered as an indication that the hypothesis, H, was probably false, and vice versa. Bertrand expressed the pessimistic view that no test of this kind could give reliable results. Borel, however, in a later discussion, considered that the method described could be applied with success provided that the character, x, of the observed facts were properly chosen---were, in fact, a character which he terms ``en quelque sorte remarquable.''},

  abstract = {Recently, evidence for endemically low statistical power has cast neuroscience findings into doubt. If low statistical power plagues neuroscience, then this reduces confidence in the reported effects. However, if statistical power is not uniformly low, then such blanket mistrust might not be warranted. Here, we provide a different perspective on this issue, analyzing data from an influential study reporting a median power of 21\% across 49 meta-analyses (Button et al., 2013). We demonstrate, using Gaussian mixture modeling, that the sample of 730 studies included in that analysis comprises several subcomponents so the use of a single summary statistic is insufficient to characterize the nature of the distribution. We find that statistical power is extremely low for studies included in meta-analyses that reported a null result and that it varies substantially across subfields of neuroscience, with particularly low power in candidate gene association studies. Therefore, whereas power in neuroscience remains a critical issue, the notion that studies are systematically underpowered is not the full story: low power is far from a universal problem. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recently, researchers across the biomedical and psychological sciences have become concerned with the reliability of results. One marker for reliability is statistical power: the probability of finding a statistically significant result given that the effect exists. Previous evidence suggests that statistical power is low across the field of neuroscience. Our results present a more comprehensive picture of statistical power in neuroscience: on average, studies are indeed underpowered---some very seriously so---but many studies show acceptable or even exemplary statistical power. We show that this heterogeneity in statistical power is common across most subfields in neuroscience. This new, more nuanced picture of statistical power in neuroscience could affect not only scientific understanding, but potentially policy and funding decisions for neuroscience research.},

Methods. ~           We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that computed an MID and contained sufficient information to compute an effect size (ES). Thirty-eight studies fulfilled the criteria, resulting in 62 ESs.           Results. ~           For all but 6 studies, the MID estimates were close to one half a SD (mean = 0.495, SD = 0.155). There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options. Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs. Population-based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller ESs, and acute conditions with larger ESs. An explanation for this consistency is that research in psychology has shown that the limit of people's ability to discriminate over a wide range of tasks is approximately 1 part in 7, which is very close to half a SD.           Conclusion. ~           In most circumstances, the threshold of discrimination for changes in health-related quality of life for chronic diseases appears to be approximately half a SD.},

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes---a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

When asked, most scientists embrace these features as disciplinary norms and values. Therefore, one might expect that these valued features would be routine in daily practice. Yet, a growing body of evidence suggests that this is not the case. In the present reward system, emphasis on innovation may undermine practices that support verification. The situation is a classic collective action problem. Many individual researchers lack strong incentives to be more transparent, even though the credibility of science would benefit if everyone were more transparent. The journal article is central to the research communication process. Guidelines for authors define what aspects of the research process should be made available to the community to evaluate, critique, reuse, and extend. Scientists recognize the value of transparency, openness, and reproducibility. Improvement of journal policies can help those values become more evident in daily practice and ultimately improve the public trust in science, and science itself.

  abstract = {Replication---an important, uncommon, and misunderstood practice---is gaining appreciation in psychology. Achieving replicability is important for making research progress. If findings are not replicable, then prediction and theory development are stifled. If findings are replicable, then interrogation of their meaning and validity can advance knowledge. Assessing replicability can be productive for generating and testing hypotheses by actively confronting current understandings to identify weaknesses and spur innovation. For psychology, the 2010s might be characterized as a decade of active confrontation. Systematic and multi-site replication projects assessed current understandings and observed surprising failures to replicate many published findings. Replication efforts highlighted sociocultural challenges such as disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a personal attack rather than a healthy scientific practice, and they raised awareness that replication contributes to self-correction. Nevertheless, innovation in doing and understanding replication and its cousins, reproducibility and robustness, has positioned psychology to improve research practices and accelerate progress. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 73 is January 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.},

  abstract = {An academic scientist's professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive---getting it right---competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive---getting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.},

According to common understanding, replication is repeating a study's procedure and observing whether the prior finding recurs. This definition is intuitive, easy to apply, and incorrect. We propose that replication is a study for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research. This definition reduces emphasis on operational characteristics of the study and increases emphasis on the interpretation of possible outcomes. The purpose of replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence. Ironically, the value of replication may be strongest when existing understanding is weakest. Successful replication provides evidence of generalizability across the conditions that inevitably differ from the original study; Unsuccessful replication indicates that the reliability of the finding may be more constrained than recognized previously. Defining replication as a confrontation of current theoretical expectations clarifies its important, exciting, and generative role in scientific progress.},

Furthermore, across primary studies, we found a median power of 11.9\% to detect a small effect, 54.5\% to detect a medium effect, and 93.9\% to detect a large effect. We documented differences in average effect size and median estimated power between different types of intelligence studies (correlational studies, studies of group differences, experiments, toxicology, and behavior genetics). On average, across all meta-analyses (but not in every meta-analysis), we found evidence for small-study effects, potentially indicating publication bias and overestimated effects. We found no differences in small-study effects between different study types. We also found no convincing evidence for the decline effect, US effect, or citation bias across meta-analyses. We concluded that intelligence research does show signs of low power and publication bias, but that these problems seem less severe than in many other scientific fields.},

In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called ``co-pilot model,'' and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one's own manuscript or during the review process.},

  abstract = {Ongoing technological developments have made it easier than ever before for scientists to share their data, materials, and analysis code. Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to reuse or check published research. However, these benefits will emerge only if researchers can reproduce the analyses reported in published articles and if data are annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variable and value labels mean. Because most researchers are not trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify those that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing for Registered Reports published in the psychological literature from 2014 to 2018 and attempted to independently computationally reproduce the main results in each article. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available. Both data and code for 36 of the articles were shared. We could run the scripts for 31 analyses, and we reproduced the main results for 21 articles. Although the percentage of articles for which both data and code were shared (36 out of 62, or 58\%) and the percentage of articles for which main results could be computationally reproduced (21 out of 36, or 58\%) were relatively high compared with the percentages found in other studies, there is clear room for improvement. We provide practical recommendations based on our observations and cite examples of good research practices in the studies whose main results we reproduced.},

Diagnoses of the causes of this ``replication crisis,'' and recommendations to address it, have nearly exclusively focused on methods of data collection, analysis, and reporting. We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. We propose a distinction between discovery-oriented and theory-testing research. In discovery-oriented research, theories do not strongly imply hypotheses by which they can be tested, but rather define a search space for the discovery of effects that would support them. Failures to find these effects do not question the theory. This endeavor necessarily engenders a high risk of Type I errors---that is, publication of findings that will not replicate. Theory-testing research, by contrast, relies on theories that strongly imply hypotheses, such that disconfirmation of the hypothesis provides evidence against the theory. Theory-testing research engenders a smaller risk of Type I errors. A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models. We critically revisit recommendations for addressing the ``replication crisis,'' including the proposal to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory research, and the preregistration of hypotheses and analysis plans.},

Among the many examined effects, examples include the Stroop effect, the ``verbal overshadowing'' effect, and various priming effects such as ``anchoring'' effects. We found limited heterogeneity; 48/68 (71\%) meta-analyses had nonsignificant heterogeneity, and most (49/68; 72\%) were most likely to have zero to small heterogeneity. Power to detect small heterogeneity (as defined by Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, \& Altman, 2003) was low for all projects (mean 43\%), but good to excellent for medium and large heterogeneity. Our findings thus show little evidence of widespread heterogeneity in direct replication studies in social and cognitive psychology, suggesting that minor changes in sample population and settings are unlikely to affect research outcomes in these fields of psychology. We also found strong correlations between observed average effect sizes (standardized mean differences and log odds ratios) and heterogeneity in our sample. Our results suggest that heterogeneity and moderation of effects is unlikely for a 0 average true effect size, but increasingly likely for larger average true effect size.

  abstract = {There are arbitrary decisions to be made (i.e., researcher degrees of freedom) in the execution and reporting of most research. These decisions allow for many possible outcomes from a single study. Selective reporting of results from this `multiverse' of outcomes, whether intentional (\_p\_-hacking) or not, can lead to inflated effect size estimates and false positive results in the literature. In this study, we examine and illustrate the consequences of researcher degrees of freedom in primary research, both for primary outcomes and for subsequent meta-analyses. We used a set of 10 preregistered multi-lab direct replication projects from psychology (Registered Replication Reports) with a total of 14 primary outcome variables, 236 labs and 37,602 participants. By exploiting researcher degrees of freedom in each project, we were able to compute between 3,840 and 2,621,440 outcomes per lab. We show that researcher degrees of freedom in primary research can cause substantial variability in effect size that we denote the Underlying Multiverse Variability (UMV). In our data, the median UMV across labs was 0.1 standard deviations (interquartile range = 0.09 -- 0.15). In one extreme case, the effect size estimate could change by \_d\_ = 1.27, evidence that \_p\_-hacking in some (rare) cases can provide support for almost any conclusion. We also show that researcher degrees of freedom in primary research provide another source of uncertainty in meta-analysis beyond those usually estimated. This would not be a large concern for meta-analysis if researchers made all arbitrary decisions at random. However, emulating selective reporting of lab results led to inflation of meta-analytic average effect size estimates in our data by as much as 0.1 - 0.48 standard deviations, depending to a large degree on the number of possible outcomes at the lab level (i.e., multiverse size). Our results illustrate the importance of making research decisions transparent (e.g., through preregistration and multiverse analysis), evaluating studies for selective reporting, and whenever feasible  making raw data available.},

Fifty-four participants were allocated into four groups according to age and strength training level: older untrained (n~=~14; 65.6~{\textpm}~2.9~years), older trained (n~=~12; 63.6~{\textpm}~3.8~years), young untrained (n~=~14; 26.2~{\textpm}~3.7~years), and young trained (n~=~14; 26.7~{\textpm}~3.4~years). Knee extension isometric voluntary explosive torque (absolute and normalized as a percentage of maximal voluntary torque) was assessed at the beginning of the contraction (ie, 50, 100, and 150~ms-T50, T100, and T150, respectively), and surface electromyogram (sEMG) amplitude (normalized as a percentage of sEMG recorded during maximal voluntary isometric contraction) at 0-50, 50-100, and 100-150 time windows. Supramaximal electrically evoked T50 was assessed with octet trains delivered to the femoral nerve (8 pulses at 300~Hz). Voluntary T50, T100, and T150 were higher for trained than untrained in absolute (P~{$<~$}0.001) and normalized (P~{$<~$}0.030) terms, accompanied by higher sEMG at 0-50, 50-100, and 100-150~ms (P~{$<~$}0.001), and voluntary T50/octet T50 ratio for trained. Greater octet T50 was observed for the young trained (P~{$<~$}0.001) but not for the older trained (P~=~0.273) compared to their untrained counterparts. Age effect was observed for voluntary T50, T100, and T150 (P~{$<~$}0.050), but normalization removed these differences (P~{$>~$}0.417). Chronically strength-trained young and older men presented a greater explosive torque than their untrained pairs. In young trained, the greater explosive performance was attributed to enhanced muscular and neural mechanisms, while in older trained to neural mechanisms only.},

Cumming's ``new statistics'' are, as he acknowledges, not new at all---no Bayesian analysis or scary mathematical modeling of phenomena or other approaches (e.g., Ludbrook \& Dudley, 1998). Instead, it is based on the use of effect sizes (ES), confidence intervals (CI), and meta-analyses instead of null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) (i.e., the ``old statistics''). This volume's real strength is that it provides a good overview of the different types of ES, how to view CI in a variety of situations, and how to conduct meta-analyses. Cumming even acknowledges that there are problems with the ``new statistics'' that have to be worked out before progress can be made (e.g., confusion over the ES Cohen's d when it is difficult to determine which version is being reported; see ``Names and Symbols,'' pp. 295--296). The reviewer thinks that there is much merit in Cumming's text and that it would make a good core text in undergraduate or graduate statistics courses after the traditional introductory course on psychological statistics.

Interpreting ES magnitude requires combining information from the numerical ES value and the context of the research. However, many researchers adopt popular benchmarks such as those proposed by Cohen. More recently, researchers have proposed interpreting ES magnitude relative to the distribution of observed ESs in a specific field, creating unique benchmarks for declaring effects small, medium or large. However, there is no valid rationale whatsoever for this approach. This study was carried out in two parts: (1) We identified articles that proposed the use of field-specific ES distributions to interpret magnitude (primary articles); and (2) We identified articles that cited the primary articles and classified them by year and publication type. The first type consisted of methodological papers. The second type included articles that interpreted ES magnitude using the approach proposed in the primary articles. There has been a steady increase in the number of methodological and substantial articles discussing or adopting the approach of interpreting ES magnitude by considering the distribution of observed ES in that field, even though the approach is devoid of a theoretical framework. It is hoped that this research will restrict the practice of interpreting ES magnitude relative to the distribution of ES values in a field and instead encourage researchers to interpret such by considering the specific context of the study.},

Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36\% of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77\% of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95\% prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers' intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals-and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

Little change seems possible once the procedure becomes well ingrained in the minds and current practice of researchers; thus, the optimal opportunity for such change is at the time the procedure is taught, be this at undergraduate or at postgraduate levels. This paper presents a tutorial for the teaching of data testing procedures, often referred to as hypothesis testing theories. The first procedure introduced is Fisher's approach to data testing---tests of significance; the second is Neyman-Pearson's approach---tests of acceptance; the final procedure is the incongruent combination of the previous two theories into the current approach---NSHT. For those researchers sticking with the latter, two compromise solutions on how to improve NHST conclude the tutorial.}

A key problem, however, is that what is available is the sample-size estimate of the effect size, and its use can lead to severely underpowered studies when the effect size is overestimated. As a potential remedy, we introduce safeguard power analysis, which uses the uncertainty in the estimate of the effect size to achieve a better likelihood of correctly identifying the population effect size. Using a lower-bound estimate of the effect size, in turn, allows researchers to calculate a sample size for a replication study that helps protect it from being underpowered. We show that in most common instances, compared with nominal power, safeguard power is higher whereas standard power is lower. We additionally recommend the use of safeguard power analysis to evaluate the strength of the evidence provided by the original study.},

  abstract = {The trim and fill method allows estimation of an adjusted meta-analysis estimate in the presence of publication bias. To date, the performance of the trim and fill method has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in a number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those from usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely use of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in the meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the performance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study heterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive effect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is present the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than the usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate from the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the presence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our simulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the presence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce the bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not ideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly caused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the performance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various meta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form of sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This investigation examined the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) recovery after simulated collision sport exercise. METHODS: Ten male rugby athletes performed three sessions consisting of a 2 {\texttimes} 30-min intermittent-sprint exercise (ISE) protocol with either tackling (T) or no tackling (CONT), followed by a 20-min CWI intervention (TCWI) or passive recovery (TPASS and CONT) in a randomized order. The ISE consisted of a 15-m sprint every minute separated by self-paced bouts of hard running, jogging, and walking for the remainder of the minute. Every sixth rotation, participants performed 5 {\texttimes} 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on each effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with voluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function (voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of perceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for metabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, immediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery. RESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in CONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P {$>$} 0.05). TCWI resulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P {$<$} 0.05). M-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and 2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P {$<$} 0.05). Although TCWI had no effect on the elevation in blood markers for muscle damage (P {$>$} 0.05), lactate was significantly reduced after recovery compared with TPASS (P = 0.04). CWI also resulted in reduced MS 2 h after recovery compared with TPASS (P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of body contact reduces exercise performance, whereas the use of CWI results in a faster recovery of MVC, VA, and RMS and improves muscle contractile properties and perceptions of soreness after collision-based exercise.},

They supported their argument by claiming that (a) psychology, like genetics, consists of complex phenomena explained by additive small effects; (b) psychological-research culture rewards large effects, which means small effects are being ignored; and (c) small effects become meaningful at scale and over time. We rebut these claims with three objections: First, the analogy between genetics and psychology is misleading; second, p values are the main currency for publication in psychology, meaning that any biases in the literature are (currently) caused by pressure to publish statistically significant results and not large effects; and third, claims regarding small effects as important and consequential must be supported by empirical evidence or, at least, a falsifiable line of reasoning. If accepted uncritically, we believe the arguments of G{\"o}tz et al. could be used as a blanket justification for the importance of any and all ?small? effects, thereby undermining best practices in effect-size interpretation. We end with guidance on evaluating effect sizes in relative, not absolute, terms.},

Here, we report an observational study in which we investigated psychologists' attitudes concerning marginal significance by examining their language in over 1,500 articles published in top-tier cognitive, developmental, and social psychology journals. We observed a large change over the course of four decades in psychologists' tendency to describe a p value as marginally significant, and overall rates of use appear to differ across subfields. We discuss possible explanations for these findings, as well as their implications for psychological research.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: From an energy perspective, the brain is very metabolically demanding. It is well documented that creatine plays a key role in brain bioenergetics.  There is some evidence that creatine supplementation can augment brain creatine  stores, which could increase memory. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and  meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to determine  the effects of creatine supplementation on memory performance in healthy humans.  DATA SOURCES: The literature was searched through the PubMed, Web of Science,  Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases from inception until September 2021. DATA  EXTRACTION: Twenty-three eligible RCTs were initially identified. Ten RCTs  examining the effect of creatine supplementation compared with placebo on  measures of memory in healthy individuals met the inclusion criteria for  systematic review, 8 of which were included in the meta-analysis. DATA ANALYSIS:  Overall, creatine supplementation improved measures of memory compared with  placebo (standard mean difference [SMD]\>=\>0.29, 95\%CI, 0.04-0.53; I2\,=\,66\%;  P\,=\,0.02). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant improvement in memory in  older adults (66-76\,years) (SMD\>=\>0.88; 95\%CI, 0.22-1.55; I2\,=\,83\%; P\,=\,0.009)  compared with their younger counterparts (11-31\,years) (SMD\>=\>0.03; 95\%CI, -0.14  to 0.20; I2\,=\,0\%; P\,=\,0.72). Creatine dose ({$\approx$}\>2.2-20\,g/d), duration of  intervention (5\,days to 24\,weeks), sex, or geographical origin did not influence  the findings. CONCLUSION: Creatine supplementation enhanced measures of memory  performance in healthy individuals, especially in older adults (66-76\,years).

  abstract = {Various factors have been attributed to the inconsistent reproducibility of human oxytocin research in the cognitive and behavioral sciences. These factors include  small sample sizes, a lack of pre-registered studies, and the absence of  overarching theoretical frameworks that can account for oxytocin's effects over a  broad range of contexts. While there have been efforts to remedy these issues,  there has been very little systematic scrutiny of the role of auxiliary  assumptions, which are claims that are not central for testing a hypothesis but  nonetheless critical for testing theories. For instance, the hypothesis that  oxytocin increases the salience of social cues is predicated on the assumption  that intranasally administered oxytocin increases oxytocin levels in the brain.  Without robust auxiliary assumptions, it is unclear whether a hypothesis testing  failure is due to an incorrect hypothesis or poorly supported auxiliary  assumptions. Consequently, poorly supported auxiliary assumptions can be blamed  for hypothesis failure, thereby safeguarding theories from falsification. In this  article, I will evaluate the body of evidence for key auxiliary assumptions in  human behavioral oxytocin research in terms of theory, experimental design, and  statistical inference, and highlight assumptions that require stronger evidence.  Strong auxiliary assumptions will leave hypotheses vulnerable for falsification,  which will improve hypothesis testing and consequently advance our understanding  of oxytocin's role in cognition and behavior.},

Meta-analysis is viewed as the gold-standard for synthesizing evidence, but the evidential value of a meta-analysis is dependent on the evidential value of the studies it synthesizes, and the analytical approaches used to derive conclusions. To assess the evidential value of oxytocin administration meta-analyses, this study calculated the statistical power of 107 studies from 35 meta-analyses and assessed the statistical equivalence of reported results. The mean statistical power across all studies was 12.2\% and there has been no noticeable improvement in power over an eight-year period. None of the 26 non-significant meta-analyses were statistically equivalent, assuming a smallest effect size of interest of 0.1. Altogether, most oxytocin treatment study designs are statistically underpowered to either detect or reject a wide range of worthwhile effect sizes.},

Brazilian researchers indicated a lower tendency to engage in two QRPs (failing to report all of a study's dependent measures; deciding whether to collect more data after looking to see whether the results were significant) when compared to their Italian and North American counterparts, but indicated a higher tendency to engage in two other QRPs (selectively reporting studies that ``worked''; not reporting all of a study's conditions). Most of the sample did not admit integrity conflicts in their own research but indicated that others have integrity problems, as observed in previous studies. Those discrepancies could be attributed to contextual and systemic factors regarding different publication demands among the different nations. Further studies should focus on identifying the antecedents of QRPs.},

  abstract = {The effects of plyometric jump training on the physical fitness of male youth (age~=~10-17~years) soccer players was examined in relation to inter-set recovery intervals and the maturity of the players in a single-blind, randomized-and controlled crossover trial. Jumping tests and kicking velocities were measured before (T0), after a 6~week control period (T1), after 6~weeks of plyometrics (T2), after 6~weeks of wash-out (T3), and after a further 6~weeks of plyometrics (T4). Subjects were divided into pre- and post- peak-height-velocity (PHV) groups, and were randomly assigned to 30~s or 120~s inter-set intervals during periods T2 and T4. Any changes in jumping and maximum kicking velocities during T1 and T3, had trivial effect sizes (0.01-0.15), but small to moderate improvements (effect size~=~0.20-0.99) were observed in both groups during T2 and T4. Gains in pre-PHV players were similar for the two inter-set intervals, but gains in post-PHV players were greater (p~{$<~$}0.05) with an inter-set recovery of 120~s than with a 30~s recovery. We conclude that plyometric jump training improves the physical fitness of adolescents, irrespective of their maturity, but that in older individuals gains are greater with a longer inter-set recovery interval.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of different volume and training surfaces during a short-term plyometric training program on neuromuscular performance. Twenty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control group (CG, n = 5), moderate volume group (MVG, n = 9, 780 jumps), moderate volume hard surface group (MVGHS, n = 8, 780 jumps), and high volume group (HVG, n = 7, 1,560 jumps). A series of tests were performed by the subjects before and after 7 weeks of plyometric training. These tests were measurement of maximum strength (5 maximum repetitions [5RMs]), drop jumps (DJs) of varying heights (20, 40, and 60 cm), squat and countermovement jumps (SJ and CMJ, respectively), timed 20-m sprint, agility, body weight, and height. The results of the present study suggest that high training volume leads to a significant increase in explosive performance that requires fast stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) actions (such as DJ and sprint) in comparison to what is observed after a moderate training volume regimen. Second, when plyometric training is performed on a hard training surface (high-impact reaction force), a moderate training volume induces optimal stimulus to increase explosive performance requiring fast SSC actions (e.g., DJ), maximal dynamic strength enhancement, and higher training efficiency. Thus, a finding of interest in the study was that after 7 weeks of plyometric training, performance enhancement in maximal strength and in actions requiring fast SSC (such as DJ and sprint) were dependent on the volume of training and the surface on which it was performed. This must be taken into account when using plyometric training on different surfaces.},

  abstract = {\&quot;{\dots}the dominant model of science in the field [that prioritizes experiments and hypothesis testing over real-world description] is appropriate only for a well-developed science, in which basic, real-world phenomena have been identified, important invariances in these phenomena have been documented, and appropriate model systems that capture the essence of these phenomena have been developed\&quot;. [Rozin, 2001, p. 2] Debates about competing approaches to skill acquisition (specifically information-processing vs. ecological based approaches) have dominated recent conversations, both among academics and practitioners. Our central argument in this article is that the above referenced quote by Rozin (1), originally made in the context of social psychology, is equally applicable to the field of skill acquisition in sport. Focusing on the current state of empirical work, we argue that there is not sufficient empirical data to constrain theories in skill acquisition research, and that trying to choose theories based on such limited data is both premature and detrimental to the development of the field itself.A theory is only as good as the data it explains. For example, consider the difference between skill acquisition and a closely related research field like motor control. In motor control, there are examples of well-established invariances such as Fitts\&\#39; law (2,3) or spatiotemporal characteristics of reaching trajectories (4,5). These robust and replicable phenomena provide such a strong empirical constraint that any new proposed theory of motor control is a non-starter if it did not account for these fundamental observations (6,7). In stark contrast, it is difficult to think of any finding that poses such a constraint to a theory of skill acquisition in sport. Instead, most phenomena in skill acquisition are characterized by two features -(a) they tend to be highly context-sensitive (i.e., influenced by factors such as the type of task and the stage of learning), and (b) they tend not to have quantitative process-level descriptions and instead focus mainly on outcome measures. While context-sensitivity is perhaps a reflection of the fact that skill acquisition is inherently sensitive to the learner and the learning context as seen by concepts such as desirable difficulties (8) or the challenge point (9), this also means that literature is filled with fragmented and seemingly contradictory findings. Coupled with the lack of quantitative descriptions, this has meant that current theories of skill acquisition tend to live within little bubbles of data.Can we really choose between theories of skill acquisition? However, despite the lack of robust findings, there is an attempt to follow the conventions of more mature sciences such as doing \&\#39;strong inference\&\#39; (10). Theories are often posed as being diametrically opposite on particular issues (e.g., \&quot;in theory A, variability is good for learning, whereas in theory B variability is bad for learning\&quot;). But while this contrast is helpful in that it raises awareness about the different ways in which we think about these phenomena, in most cases, theories are not specific enough to make predictions. In other words, there is no subsequent critical experiment which could distinguish between theory A or theory B because the question itself -i.e., \&quot;is variability good or bad for learning\&quot; -is ill-posed without knowledge of the context (e.g., the stage of learning, how much variability is being introduced, and what type of task is being learned) (11). In these cases, the strategy of having theories compete by constructing these binary oppositions is less likely to advance science (12).Another major issue regarding the data is the question of how much these results matter in realworld conditions. For example, most motor learning experiments, often used as the basis for skill acquisition, still rely on constrained tasks that rarely resemble the complexity of real-world (13,14). In addition, with limited sample sizes being an important factor constraining research studies, it is ideal in an experimental sense to maximize the effect size (i.e., the potential difference between groups) as much as possible. As a result, the contrast between groups is often exaggerated with \&\#39;strawman\&\#39; versions of groups that bear little resemblance to real-world skill acquisition (15) . For example, the information processing approach has been associated with \&\#39;prescription\&\#39; of an ideal movement pattern (often borrowed straight from a manual) with no room for individual differences, variability, or real-time flexibility, whereas the ecological approach has been associated with a trial-and-error \&\#39;self-organization\&\#39; approach to finding a movement solution with no room for planning, instructions demonstrations, or explicit strategies. As a result, even when these methods are directly compared (16)(17)(18), many researchers and practitioners remain unconvinced about the impact of such evidence on realworld contexts.We wish to emphasize that our goal is not to criticize theorizing itself. Challenging the theoretical status quo has brought important new perspectives to the field, which in turn has guided empirical data collection in new directions. For example, the focus on organism-taskenvironment as a whole ( 19) is an important perspective change on the role of the coach in terms of being \&\#39;environment designers\&\#39; (20,21). However, in prematurely trying to choose between theories, or derive implications for real-world situations, there is a danger of overgeneralization based on phenomena that have mainly been observed in niche experimental paradigms. We suggest two recommendations for improving the discourse-from a researcher\&\#39;s view and a practitioner\&\#39;s view.From a researcher\&\#39;s view, we propose that instead of the standard hypothesis testing/falsification paradigm, skill acquisition is much more suited to the \&\#39;inductive theory building\&\#39; approach (22), which argues for building a \&\#39;substantial body of data\&\#39; across different real-world contexts (using different methods, participants, time spans etc.) . In particular, there is a need for data collection outside of the domain of lab experiments, which tend to focus on extremely time-limited constrained observations, that by themselves are too rudimentary for theory building. The need for field-based data is a not new observation (1,23,24) but the continued lack of field-based data in guiding theories of skill acquisition seems to point to a systemic problem in what type of research is incentivized, and the need for large scale collaborations (including adversarial collaborations). In short, we need phenomena that everyone can agree on before we can test theories that people may disagree on.For an illustrative example of such theory building, one might look at the development of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) over the past 50 years. SDT began with experimental designs to examine the effects of incentives on creative problem solving using SOMA puzzles (25). When these experiments showed that incentives undermined participants\&\#39; willingness to engage with the puzzles during a break period, it questioned behaviorist tenets of the importance of incentives and reinforcement in volitional behavior and gave rise to the core construct of intrinsic motivation. Today, SDT is a \&quot;meta-theory\&quot; composed of six subtheories, each with an explanatory capacity for specific aspects of volitional behavior. Two features of SDT stand out as a model for skill acquisition. First, although SDT enjoys rather wide acceptance amongst behavioral scientists; few would argue that SDT accounts for all variance in volitional behavior, and few would neglect the effects of reinforcement, group norms, or other psychosocial factors in certain contexts. Second, SDT emerged from tightly-controlled, laboratory-based experimental designs, but then expanded to less-controlled, field-based quasi-experimental and even descriptive and qualitative designs. From a practitioner\&\#39;s view, we propose that skill acquisition and the utility of different coaching practices be examined from multiple lenses. Often, there is a tacit assumption that evidencebased coaching requires complete alignment of the goals of the researcher and the coach.However, this assumption can be misleading since the objectives of the researcher and the coach are quite different -researchers prioritize the search for systematic and generalizable principles whereas coaches are pragmatic and solution-focused. One example of how this difference manifests in practice is that a less optimal method of practice at one level may be preferred if it can be more efficient at a different level of analysis.For example, experimental comparisons of skill acquisition methods assume that participants receive the same number of practice repetitions in each method. However, this assumption may not always hold in the realworld. With a fixed amount of practice time, participants may often be able to do many more repetitions in a blocked or constant practice schedules because they require less changes in the environment and lesser effort from the coach. Therefore, as long as there is a non-zero learning benefit, some activities that seem suboptimal at one level (say the amount of learning/unit practice repetition) may actually be more efficient in terms of other levels (the amount of learning per unit time or per unit person-hours of coaching). Understanding these trade-offs at multiple scales of analysis is currently outside the domain of most experiments and highlights the need for more field-based work to complement lab-based work.In addition, the solution-focused approach of coaches may also explain certain coaching practices. For example, many coaches still use an \&\#39;ideal\&\#39; movement pattern even if they do not believe in imprinting this movement pattern on the learner simply because there is no other alternative. Relying purely on discovery learning may be time-consuming and increase the risk of getting stuck in maladaptive movement patterns. A researcher faced with this problem has the option of choosing a different context that is more tractable for study, but this is not an option for the solution-focused coach. Therefore, using the elite athlete\&\#39;s movement patterns may represent a reasonable compromise in this scenario, as long as it is followed by a trial-and-error process to identify an individual\&\#39;s optimal solution. In addition, many pedagogical techniques may also be effective in that they satisfy different goals beyond skill improvement (29). For example, demonstrations are associated with increasing selfefficacy, reducing anxiety, and learning strategies or game plans (30). Although the above arguments are not meant as a general defense of all current coaching practices, it may be more fruitful to move debates away from \&quot;is coaching practice X important?\&quot; to \&quot;when is coaching practice X important?\&quot;. In summary, we need a large and robust body of data to advance theoretical debates on skill acquisition in a meaningful way. One approach that may especially be fruitful in this process is the \&\#39;informed curiosity approach\&\#39; (1). Taking a middle path between the two extremes of hypothesis testing and simply amassing more data, the informed curiosity approach is characterized by attempts to answer open-ended questions that prioritize description of phenomena in ecologically valid contexts. For example, to understand the role of variability in learning, instead of a typical hypothesis-testing approach that compares two groups, an informed-curiosity approach would focus on describing the entire dose-response curve between variability and learning using multiple groups in a real-world task. Such descriptions of a functional relation between variables (31) provides a much better constraint on theory development than the two-group design where the nature of the result (both in terms of direction and effect size) is often highly sensitive to how the two groups are selected (32).Given the much higher effort involved in collecting this type of descriptive data and the breadth of skill acquisition in sport, a first step is to identify a few representative contexts that can be the focus of immediate efforts. Even in the laboratory setting, the use of select \&\#39;model tasks\&\#39; has been proposed to reduce task fragmentation and strike a balance between internal and ecological validity (32). By identifying a small set of common tasks that can capture different aspects of skill acquisition (similar to how model organisms are used in biology), researchers will be able to compile data across labs and obtain larger sample sizes, which can potentially lead to the discovery of invariances (in the same mold as Fitts\&\#39; law) that become the basis for theorizing. However, based on similar efforts in other domains (33)(34)(35)(36), achieving even this first step requires coordinated large-scale collaborations between academic researchers, sport scientists, coaches, and athletes in a way that runs counter to the current model of conducting research within a single lab. Creating the infrastructure and the incentive structure for these types of collaborations may ultimately be the most important piece for a theory of skill acquisition.},

  abstract = {Background: Registration of clinical trials has been introduced largely to reduce bias toward statistically significant results in the trial literature. Doubts remain about whether advance registration alone is an adequate measure to reduce selective publication, selective outcome reporting, and biased design. One of the first areas of medicine in which registration was widely adopted was oncology, although the bulk of registered oncology trials remain unpublished. The net influence of registration on the literature remains untested. This study compares the prevalence of favorable results and conclusions among published reports of registered and unregistered randomized controlled trials of new oncology drugs. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of published original research articles reporting clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of drugs newly approved for antimalignancy indications by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2000 through 2005. Drugs receiving first-time approval for indications in oncology were identified using the FDA web site and Thomson Centerwatch. Relevant trial reports were identified using PubMed and the Cochrane Library. Evidence of advance trial registration was obtained by a search of clinicaltrials.gov, WHO, ISRCTN, NCI-PDQ trial databases and corporate trial registries, as well as articles themselves. Data on blinding, results for primary outcomes, and author conclusions were extracted independently by two coders. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified associations between favorable results and conclusions and independent variables including advance registration, study design characteristics, and industry sponsorship. Results: Of 137 original research reports from 115 distinct randomized trials assessing 25 newly approved drugs for treating cancer, the 54 publications describing data from trials registered prior to publication were as likely to report statistically significant efficacy results and reach conclusions favoring the test drug (for results, OR = 1.77; 95\% CI = 0.87 to 3.61) as reports of trials not registered in advance. In multivariate analysis, reports of prior registered trials were again as likely to favor the test drug (OR = 1.29; 95\% CI = 0.54 to 3.08); large sample sizes and surrogate outcome measures were statistically significant predictors of favorable efficacy results at p {$<$} 0.05. Subgroup analysis of the main reports from each trial (n = 115) similarly indicated that registered trials were as likely to report results favoring the test drug as trials not registered in advance (OR = 1.11; 95\% CI = 0.44 to 2.80), and also that large trials and trials with nonstringent blinding were significantly more likely to report results favoring the test drug. Conclusions: Trial registration alone, without a requirement for full reporting of research results, does not appear to reduce a bias toward results and conclusions favoring new drugs in the clinical trials literature. Our findings support the inclusion of full results reporting in trial registers, as well as protocols to allow assessment of whether results have been completely reported.},

We explain the importance of interpreting subgroup analyses, and demonstrate how to interpret subgroup analyses using theoretical examples and a real-life subgroup analysis with clinical context. Finally, we provide recommendations for the interpretation of subgroup analyses in systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of napping after partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on reaction time, mood, and biochemical response to repeated-sprint exercise in athletes. METHODS: Nine male judokas performed 4 test sessions in a counterbalanced and randomized order. Participants accomplished 1 control session after a normal sleep night (NSN) and 3 after PSD with (1)~no nap, (2)~{$\sim$}20-min nap (N20), and (3)~{$\sim$}90-min nap (N90) opportunities. Test sessions included the running-based anaerobic sprint test, reaction time, Hooper index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Muscle-damage biomarkers and antioxidant status were evaluated before and after exercise. RESULTS: PSD decreased maximum (P {$<$} .001, d = 1.12), mean (P {$<$} .001, d = 1.33), and minimum (P {$<$} .001, d = 1.15) powers compared with NSN. However, N20 and N90 enhanced maximum power compared with PSD (P {$<$} .05, d = 0.54; P {$<$} .001, d = 1.06, respectively). Minimum power and mean power increased only after N90 (P {$<$} .001, d = 1.63; P {$<$} .001, d = 1.16, respectively). Epworth Sleepiness Scale increased after PSD (P {$<$} .001, d = 0.86) and decreased after N20 (P {$<$} .001, d = 1.36) and N90 (P {$<$} .001, d = 2.07). N20 reduced multiple-choice reaction time (P {$<$} .001, d = 0.61). Despite performance decrement, PSD increased postexercise aspartate aminotransferase (P {$<$} .001, d = 4.16) and decreased glutathione peroxidase (P {$<$} .001, d = 4.02) compared with NSN. However, the highest performances after N90 were accompanied with lesser aspartate aminotransferase (P {$<$} .001, d = 1.74) and higher glutathione peroxidase (P {$<$} .001, d = 0.86) compared with PSD. CONCLUSIONS: Napping could be preventive against performance degradation caused by sleep loss. A short nap opportunity could be more beneficial when the subsequent effort is brief and requires frequent decision making. However, a longer nap opportunity could be preventive against muscle and oxidative damage, even for higher performances.},

This article introduces philosophers to these discussions. First, I discuss precedents and evidence for the crisis. Second, I discuss methodological, statistical, and social-structural factors that have contributed to the crisis. Third, I focus on the philosophical issues raised by the crisis.

Much of the criticism of meta-analysis has been based on simple misunderstanding of how meta-analyses are actually carried out. Criticisms of meta-analysis that are applicable are equally applicable to traditional, nonquantitative, narrative reviews of the literature.

We show that recasting the effect size into a binomial display is a convenient way of revealing the practical significance of r in terms of whatever equivalency measure is deemed appropriate (e.g., improvement rate, success rate, survival rate).

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Beneficial effects of carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion on exogenous CHO oxidation and endurance performance require a well-functioning gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, GI complaints are common during endurance running. This study investigated the effect of a CHO solution-containing sodium alginate and pectin (hydrogel) on endurance running performance, exogenous and endogenous CHO oxidation, and GI symptoms. METHODS: Eleven trained male runners, using a randomized, double-blind design, completed three 120-min steady-state runs at 68\% V˙O2max, followed by a 5-km time-trial. Participants ingested 90 g{$\cdot$}h-1 of 2:1 glucose-fructose (13C enriched) as a CHO hydrogel, a standard CHO solution (nonhydrogel), or a CHO-free placebo during the 120 min. Fat oxidation, total and exogenous CHO oxidation, plasma glucose oxidation, and endogenous glucose oxidation from liver and muscle glycogen were calculated using indirect calorimetry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. GI symptoms were recorded throughout the trial. RESULTS: Time-trial performance was 7.6\% and 5.6\% faster after hydrogel ([min:s] 19:29 {\textpm} 2:24, P {$<$} 0.001) and nonhydrogel (19:54 {\textpm} 2:23, P = 0.002), respectively, versus placebo (21:05 {\textpm} 2:34). Time-trial performance after hydrogel was 2.1\% faster (P = 0.033) than nonhydrogel. Absolute and relative exogenous CHO oxidation was greater with hydrogel (68.6 {\textpm} 10.8 g, 31.9\% {\textpm} 2.7\%; P = 0.01) versus nonhydrogel (63.4 {\textpm} 8.1 g, 29.3\% {\textpm} 2.0\%; P = 0.003). Absolute and relative endogenous CHO oxidation was lower in both CHO conditions compared with placebo (P {$<$} 0.001), with no difference between CHO conditions. Absolute and relative liver glucose oxidation and muscle glycogen oxidation were not different between CHO conditions. Total GI symptoms were not different between hydrogel and placebo, but GI symptoms were higher in nonhydrogel compared with placebo and hydrogel (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ingestion of glucose and fructose in hydrogel form during running benefited endurance performance, exogenous CHO oxidation, and GI symptoms compared with a standard CHO solution.},

In this article, we introduce the concept of a limit meta-analysis, which leads to shrunken, empirical Bayes estimates of study effects after allowing for small-study effects. This in turn leads to 3 model-based adjusted pooled treatment-effect estimators and associated confidence intervals. We show how visualizing our estimators using the radial plot indicates how they can be calculated using existing software. The concept of limit meta-analysis also gives rise to a new measure of heterogeneity, termed G(2), for heterogeneity that remains after small-study effects are accounted for. In a simulation study with binary data and small-study effects, we compared our proposed estimators with those currently used together with a recent proposal by Moreno and others. Our criteria were bias, mean squared error (MSE), variance, and coverage of 95\% confidence intervals. Only the estimators arising from the limit meta-analysis produced approximately unbiased treatment-effect estimates in the presence of small-study effects, while the MSE was acceptably small, provided that the number of studies in the meta-analysis was not less than 10. These limit meta-analysis estimators were also relatively robust against heterogeneity and one of them had a relatively small coverage error.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Impact factor, an index based on the frequency with which a journal's articles are cited in scientific publications, is a putative marker of journal quality. However, empiric studies on impact factor's validity as an indicator of quality are lacking. The authors assessed the validity of impact factor as a measure of quality for general medical journals by testing its association with journal quality as rated by clinical practitioners and researchers. METHODS: We surveyed physicians specializing in internal medicine in the United States, randomly sampled from the American Medical Association's Physician Masterfile (practitioner group, n = 113) and from a list of graduates from a national postdoctoral training program in clinical and health services research (research group, n = 151). Respondents rated the quality of nine general medical journals, and we assessed the correlation between these ratings and the journals' impact factors. RESULTS: The correlation between impact factor and physicians' ratings of journal quality was strong (r2 = 0.82, P = 0.001). The correlation was higher for the research group (r2 = 0.83, P = 0.001) than for the practitioner group (r2 = 0.62, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Impact factor may be a reasonable indicator of quality for general medical journals.},

Specifically, we see two pressing needs: (1) to increase collaboration between researchers and statisticians, and (2) to increase statistical training within the exercise science/medicine/physiotherapy (PT) discipline. Our call to action extends the work of those who have previously called for increased statistical collaboration in sports medicine and sports injury research.19--21  Though some academic sports science and medicine studies employ statisticians, such collaborations are an exception rather than the norm. To determine the extent of collaboration, we performed a systematic review of articles published in quartile one sports science journals in 2019 (see online supplementary file 1 for methods and online supplementary file 2 for data). The initial extraction included 8970 articles; of the 400 articles selected at random, 299 were deemed eligible and included in the review (figure 1). We found that only 13.3\% (95\% CI: 9.5\% to 17.2\%) of papers had at least one coauthor affiliated with a biostatistics, statistics, data science, data analytics, epidemiology, maths, computer science or economics department (figure 2). It should be noted that we included a broad set of methodological departments because we recognise that individuals from these fields may possess considerable statistical expertise. When we use the term `statistician' in this paper, we broadly include individuals from other methods-focussed disciplines if they have extensive statistical training and experience.\#\#\# Supplementary data [bjsports-2020-102607supp001.pdf] \#\#\# Supplementary data [bjsports-2020-102607supp002.pdf] Figure 1 Flowchart of the article search and inclusion for the systematic review.

We review 52 articles in organization studies and develop a typology of how researchers construct their research questions from existing literature. The most common way across paradigmatic camps is to spot various ?gaps? in the literature and, based on that, to formulate specific research questions. The dominance of gap-spotting is surprising, given it is increasingly recognized that theory is made interesting and influential when it challenges assumptions that underlie existing literature. The article discusses why assumption-challenging approaches are rare, and it identifies a range of social norms that favour gap-spotting. Finally, the article proposes some ways of constructing research questions that move beyond gap-spotting, and discusses how these ways are likely to promote more interesting and significant theories.},

A case study using effect sizes from a recent meta-analysis of reading interventions is presented to compare the results obtained from different approaches to dealing with dependence. Overall, mean effect sizes and variance estimates were found to be similar, but estimates of indexes of heterogeneity varied. Meta-analysts are advised to explore the effect of the method of handling dependence on the heterogeneity estimates before conducting moderator analyses and to choose the approach to dependence that is best suited to their research question and their data set.},

  abstract = {Factorial experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be ``tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary `omnibus' F test'' (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties, and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard omnibus F-tests. Reproducible code is available from https://osf.io/7ukf6/.},

The interpretation of effect sizes---when is an effect small, medium, or large?---has been guided by the recommendations Jacob Cohen gave in his pioneering writings starting in 1962: Either compare an effect with the effects found in past research or use certain conventional benchmarks. The present analysis shows that neither of these recommendations is currently applicable. From past publications without pre-registration, 900 effects were randomly drawn and compared with 93 effects from publications with pre-registration, revealing a large difference: Effects from the former (median r = 0.36) were much larger than effects from the latter (median r = 0.16). That is, certain biases, such as publication bias or questionable research practices, have caused a dramatic inflation in published effects, making it difficult to compare an actual effect with the real population effects (as these are unknown). In addition, there were very large differences in the mean effects between psychological sub-disciplines and between different study designs, making it impossible to apply any global benchmarks. Many more pre-registered studies are needed in the future to derive a reliable picture of real population effects.},

We argue that there are different ways to define "replication failure," and that analyses can focus on exploring variation among replication studies or assess whether their results contradict the findings of the original study. We apply this framework to a set of psychological findings that have been replicated and assess the sensitivity of these analyses. We find that tests for replication that involve only a single replication study are almost always severely underpowered. Among the 40 findings for which ensembles of multisite direct replications were conducted, we find that between 11 and 17 (28\% to 43\%) ensembles produced heterogeneous effects, depending on how replication is defined. This heterogeneity could not be completely explained by moderators documented by replication research programs. We also find that these ensembles were not always well-powered to detect potentially meaningful values of heterogeneity. Finally, we identify several discrepancies between the results of original studies and the distribution of effects found by multisite replications but note that these analyses also have low power. We conclude by arguing that efforts to assess replication would benefit from further methodological work on designing replication studies to ensure analyses are sufficiently sensitive.

We compared the results in published RRs (N = 71 as of November 2018) with a random sample of hypothesis-testing studies from the standard literature (N = 152) in psychology. Analyzing the first hypothesis of each article, we found 96\% positive results in standard reports but only 44\% positive results in RRs.

In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalizing procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and influential. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychological scientists have begun to realize that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound "derivation chain" between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various nonconfirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognized and incentivized as a crucial goal in itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to nonconfirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology's reform movement and help us to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged.},

Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.

We focus on an important aspect of this debate, the impact of sample sizes, by assessing sample sizes within sport and exercise psychology. Researchers have argued that publications in psychological research contain numerous false-positive findings and inflated effect sizes due to small sample sizes. Method We analyse the four leading journals in sport and exercise psychology regarding sample sizes of all quantitative studies published in these journals between 2009 and 2013. Subsequently, we conduct power analyses. Results A substantial proportion of published studies does not have sufficient power to detect effect sizes typical for psychological research. Sample sizes and power vary between research designs. Although many correlational studies have adequate sample sizes, experimental studies are often underpowered to detect small-to-medium effects. Conclusions As sample sizes are small, research in sport and exercise psychology may suffer from false-positive results and inflated effect sizes, while at the same time failing to detect meaningful small effects. Larger sample sizes are warranted, particularly in experimental studies.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Hamstring injuries in soccer reportedly increase towards the end of the matches' halves as well as with increased match frequency in combination with short rest periods, possibly due to acute or residual fatigue. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of acute and residual muscle fatigue on exercise-induced hamstring muscle damage. METHODS: A three-armed randomized-controlled trial, including 24 resistance-trained males, was performed allocating subjects to either a training group with acute muscle fatigue\,+\,eccentric exercise (AF/ECC); residual muscle fatigue\,+\,eccentric exercise (RF/ECC) or a control group with only eccentric exercise (ECC). Muscle stiffness, thickness, contractility, peak torque, range of motion, pain perception, and creatine kinase were assessed as muscle damage markers pre, post, 1~h post, and on the consecutive three days. RESULTS: Significant group\,{\texttimes}\,time interactions were revealed for muscle thickness (p\,=\,0.02) and muscle contractility parameters radial displacement (Dm) and contraction velocity (Vc) (both p\,=\,0.01), with larger changes in the ECC group (partial {$\eta$}2\,=\,0.4). Peak torque dropped by an average of 22\% in all groups; stiffness only changed in the RF/ECC group (p\,=\,0.04). Muscle work during the damage protocol was lower for AF/ECC than for ECC and RF/ECC (p\,=\,0.005). CONCLUSION: Hamstring muscle damage was comparable between the three groups. However, the AF/ECC group resulted in the same amount of muscle damage while accumulating significantly less muscle work during the protocol of the damage exercise. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was preregistered in the international trial registration platform (WHO; registration number: DRKS00025243).},

The replication crisis in psychology showed that published findings employing statistical inference are threatened by undetected errors, data manipulation and data falsification. To mitigate these problems and bolster research credibility, open data and preregistration practices have gained traction in the natural and social sciences. However, the extent of their adoption in different disciplines is unknown. We introduce computational procedures to identify the transparency of a research field using large-scale text analysis and machine learning classifiers. Using political science and international relations as an illustrative case, we examine 93 931 articles across the top 160 political science and international relations journals between 2010 and 2021. We find that approximately 21\% of all statistical inference papers have open data and 5\% of all experiments are preregistered. Despite this shortfall, the example of leading journals in the field shows that change is feasible and can be effected quickly.},

This chapter argues that sample size issues are sometimes over-stressed at expense of others in clinical trials. The usual point of view is that the sample size is the determined function of variability, statistical method, power, and difference sought. A very unsatisfactory feature of conventional approaches to sample size calculation is that there is no mention of cost. The chapter discusses that there are various Bayesian suggestions. It considers an alternative frequentist approach to going beyond the P-value, that of severity, an approach championed by Deborah Mayo. P-values are a perfectly reasonable way for scientists to communicate the results of a significance test even if decisions rather than inferences are the object.},

The prevalence of supplement use remained constant over time (2009: 97\%, 1998: 100\%). However, the current swimmers used a greater number of dietary supplements (9.2 {\textpm} 3.7 and 5.9 {\textpm} 2.9; p = .001), accounted for by an increase in the reported use of supplements with a greater evidence base (Sports Foods, Ergogenics, and Group B supplements).

AIS swimmers reported a greater use of Ergogenics (4.3 {\textpm} 1.8 and 3.1 {\textpm} 1.7; p = .002), and less use of Group C and D supplements overall (0.8 {\textpm} 1.2 and 1.3 {\textpm} 1.2; p = .012), which was explained primarily by a smaller number of these supplements reported by the 2009 group (1998 AIS: 1.5 {\textpm} 1.4, 2009 AIS: 0.2 {\textpm} 0.6; p = .004).

We aimed to characterize a null field using a known example, homeopathy (a pseudoscientific medical approach based on using highly diluted substances), as a prototype. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We identified 50 randomized placebo-controlled trials of homeopathy interventions from highly cited meta-analyses. The primary outcome variable was the observed effect size in the studies. Variables related to study quality or impact were also extracted. RESULTS: The mean effect size for homeopathy was 0.36 standard deviations (Hedges' g; 95\% confidence interval: 0.21, 0.51) better than placebo, which corresponds to an odds ratio of 1.94 (95\% CI: 1.69, 2.23) in favor of homeopathy. 80\% of studies had positive effect sizes (favoring homeopathy). Effect size was significantly correlated with citation counts from journals in the directory of open-access journals and CiteWatch. We identified common statistical errors in 25 studies. CONCLUSION: A null field like homeopathy can exhibit large effect sizes, high rates of favorable results, and high citation impact in the published scientific literature. Null fields may represent a useful negative control for the scientific process.},

The authors regret the oversight.] Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69\%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31\%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts' prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ({$\leq$} .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

  abstract = {Publication bias poses a challenge for accurately synthesizing research findings using meta-analysis. A number of statistical methods have been developed to combat this problem by adjusting the meta-analytic estimates. Previous studies tended to apply these methods without regard to optimal conditions for each method's performance. The present study sought to estimate the typical effect size attenuation of these methods when they are applied to real meta-analytic data sets that match the conditions under which each method is known to remain relatively unbiased (such as sample size, level of heterogeneity, population effect size, and the level of publication bias). Four-hundred and 33 data sets from 90 articles published in psychology journals were reanalyzed using a selection of publication bias adjustment methods. The downward adjustment found in our sample was minimal, with greatest identified attenuation of b = -.032, 95\% highest posterior density interval (HPD) ranging from -.055 to -.009, for the precision effect test (PET). Some methods tended to adjust upward, and this was especially true for data sets with a sample size smaller than 10. We propose that researchers should seek to explore the full range of plausible estimates for the effects they are studying and note that these methods may not be able to combat bias in small samples (with less than 10 primary studies). We argue that although the effect size attenuation we found tended to be minimal, this should not be taken as an indication of low levels of publication bias in psychology. We discuss the findings with reference to new developments in Bayesian methods for publication bias adjustment, and the recent methodological reforms in psychology.

Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing---no deliberate cheating nor loafing---by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more `progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

However, no research has considered sport-specific postures in field hockey. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in trunk and lower limb angle and lower extremity joint moment waveforms during UnSS while holding a hockey stick in a flexed posture (HS-UnSS) and traditional UnSS. Additionally, we aimed to determine if differences in posture during HS-UnSS were associated with changes in knee joint moments. Twelve elite female field hockey athletes underwent 3D motion analysis during UnSS and HS-UnSS. Athletes increased trunk (0--100\% of stance phase, hip (0--15\%), knee (12--29\%; 39--59\%; 78--100\%) and ankle (41--57\%) flexion angles, and increased hip flexion (19--24\%; 42--45\%; 75--84\%) and external rotation moments (75--80\%) during HS-UnSS compared with UnSS (p {$<$} 0.05). Flexed postures observed during HS-UnSS did not influence knee flexion and valgus moments when compared with UnSS (p {$>$} 0.05), however knee external rotation moments reduced. Changes in trunk flexion were positively associated with peak knee internal rotation moments from UnSS to HS-UnSS (r = 0.779, p = 0.005). These findings indicate that field hockey players sidestep with significantly different techniques when holding a hockey stick, which should be considered in injury prevention training protocols.},

This article consists of three parts. In the first part, we address the first challenge. We first use a fictional study to explain the difference between power analyses for interactions and main effects. Then, we introduce an intuitive taxonomy of 12 types of interactions based on the shape of the interaction (reversed, fully attenuated, partially attenuated) and the size of the simple slopes (median, smaller, larger), and we offer mathematically derived sample-size recommendations to detect each interaction with a power of .80/.90/.95 (for two-tailed tests in between-participants designs). In the second part, we address the second challenge. We first describe a preregistered metastudy (159 studies from recent articles in influential psychology journals) showing that the median power to detect interactions of a typical size is .18. Then, we use simulations ({$\approx$}900,000,000 data sets) to generate power curves for the 12 types of interactions and test three approaches to increase power without increasing sample size: (a) preregistering one-tailed tests (+21\% gain), (b) using a mixed design (+75\% gain), and (c) preregistering contrast analysis for a fully attenuated interaction (+62\% gain). In the third part, we introduce INT{\texttimes}Power (www.intxpower.com), a web application that enables users to draw their interaction and determine the sample size needed to reach the power of their choice with the option of using/combining these approaches.},

This paper reports on a questionnaire study of the publishing behaviour and researchers preferences for seeking new knowledge information and the possible influence of JIF on these variables. 54 Danish medical researchers active in the field of Diabetes research took part. We asked the researchers to prioritise a series of scientific journals with respect to which journals they prefer for publishing research and gaining new knowledge. In addition we requested the researchers to indicate whether or not the JIF of the prioritised journals has had any influence on these decisions. Furthermore we explored the perception of the researchers as to what degree the JIF could be considered a reliable, stable or objective measure for determining the scientific quality of journals. Moreover we asked the researchers to judge the applicability of JIF as a measure for doing research evaluations. One remarkable result is that app. 80\% of the researchers share the opinion that JIF does indeed have an influence on which journals they would prefer for publishing. As such we found a statistically significant correlation between how the researchers ranked the journals and the JIF of the ranked journals. Another notable result is that no significant correlation exists between journals where the researchers actually have published papers and journals in which they would prefer to publish in the future measured by JIF. This could be taken as an indicator for the actual motivational influence on the publication behaviour of the researchers. That is, the impact factor actually works in our case. It seems that the researchers find it fair and reliable to use the Journal Impact Factor for research evaluation purposes.},

Moderator analyses suggest that this may be driven in part by publication pressures, that the replicability of research in this area has improved since 2015, and that studies using system threat manipulations show particularly low estimated replication rates (ERR). Implications for the replicability and validity of the experimental SJT literature are discussed, and recommendations to increase the rigor of research are put forth.},

Also examined were the reporting and interpreting of effect sizes and the control for experiment-wise (EW) Type I error rates. From the two years of articles, 29 studies were analysed, and power was computed on 108 different tests of significance. The median power of the studies to detect small, medium, and large effects were .14, .65 and .97, respectively, These results suggest that exercise and sport science research, at least as represented in AJSMS, is probably underpowered and may be limited in detecting small effects, has a better, but still underpowered, chance of detecting medium effects, and has adequate power principally for detecting large effects. The reporting of effect sizes was rare, and adequate interpretation of them was even rarer. The mean EW Type I error rate for all studies was .49. The analyses conducted suggest that much research in exercise science may have substantial Type I and Type II errors. An appeal is made for exercise scientists to conduct power analyses, control for EW error, exercise caution in the interpretation of nonsignificant results, and examine, report, and interpret effect sizes rather than solely rely on p values to determine whether significant changes occurred or significant relationships exist.},

Looking for consistency between two studies is challenging because individual studies are susceptible to many sources of error that can cause study results to deviate from each other and the population effect in unpredictable directions and magnitudes. In the current paper, we derive methods to compute a prediction interval, a range of results that can be expected in a replication due to chance (i.e., sampling error), for means and commonly used indexes of effect size: correlations and d-values. The prediction interval is calculable based on objective study characteristics (i.e., effect size of the original study and sample sizes of the original study and planned replication) even when sample sizes across studies are unequal. The prediction interval provides an a priori method for assessing if the difference between an original and replication result is consistent with what can be expected due to sample error alone. We provide open-source software tools that allow researchers, reviewers, replicators, and editors to easily calculate prediction intervals.},

This study examined whether changes in running performance resulting from plyometric training were related to alterations in lower leg musculotendinous stiffness (MTS). Seventeen male runners were pre- and post-tested for lower leg MTS, maximum isometric force, rate of force development, 5-bound distance test (5BT), counter movement jump (CMJ) height, RE, VO(2max), lactate threshold (Th(la)), and 3-km time. Subjects were randomly split into an experimental (E) group which completed 6 weeks of plyometric training in conjunction with their normal running training, and a control (C) group which trained as normal. Following the training period, the E group significantly improved 3-km performance (2.7\%) and RE at each of the tested velocities, while no changes in VO(2max) or Th(la) were recorded. CMJ height, 5BT, and MTS also increased significantly. No significant changes were observed in any measures for the C group. The results clearly demonstrated that a 6-week plyometric programme led to improvements in 3-km running performance. It is postulated that the increase in MTS resulted in improved RE. We speculate that the improved RE led to changes in 3-km running performance, as there were no corresponding alterations in VO(2max) or Th(la).},

Several reasons for these failures have been proposed, the most notable being questionable research practices and data fraud. We examine replication from a different perspective and illustrate that current intuitive expectations for replication are unreasonable. We used computer simulations to create thousands of ideal replications, with the same participants, wherein the only difference across replications was random measurement error. In the first set of simulations, study results differed substantially across replications as a result of measurement error alone. This raises questions about how researchers should interpret failed replication attempts, given the large impact that even modest amounts of measurement error can have on observed associations. In the second set of simulations, we illustrated the difficulties that researchers face when trying to interpret and replicate a published finding. We also assessed the relative importance of both sampling error and measurement error in producing variability in replications. Conventionally, replication attempts are viewed through the lens of verifying or falsifying published findings. We suggest that this is a flawed perspective and that researchers should adjust their expectations concerning replications and shift to a meta-analytic mind-set.},

We introduce the weighted average of the adequately powered (WAAP) as an alternative to the conventional random-effects (RE) estimator. When the results of some of the studies have been selected to be positive and statistically significant (i.e. selective reporting), our simulations show that WAAP will have smaller bias than RE at no loss to its other statistical properties. When there is no selective reporting, the difference between RE's and WAAP's statistical properties is practically negligible. Nonetheless, when selective reporting is especially severe or heterogeneity is very large, notable bias can remain in all weighted averages. The main limitation of this approach is that the majority of meta-analyses of medical research do not contain any studies with adequate power (i.e. {$>$}80\%). For such areas of medical research, it remains important to document their low power, and, as we demonstrate, an alternative unrestricted weighted least squares weighted average can be used instead of WAAP.

Using typical conditions found in social/personality research, our simulations identify three areas of concern. PET-PEESE performs poorly in research areas where there are only a few studies, all studies use small samples, and where there is very high heterogeneity of results from study to study. Nonetheless, the statistical properties of conventional meta-analysis approaches are much worse than PET-PEESE under these same conditions.

A quadratic approximation without a linear term, precision-effect estimate with standard error (PEESE), is shown to have the smallest bias and mean squared error in most cases and to outperform conventional meta-analysis estimators, often by a great deal. Monte Carlo simulations also demonstrate how a new hybrid estimator that conditionally combines PEESE and the Egger regression intercept can provide a practical solution to publication selection bias. PEESE is easily expanded to accommodate systematic heterogeneity along with complex and differential publication selection bias that is related to moderator variables. By providing an intuitive reason for these approximations, we can also explain why the Egger regression works so well and when it does not. These meta-regression methods are applied to several policy-relevant areas of research including antidepressant effectiveness, the value of a statistical life, the minimum wage, and nicotine replacement therapy.

A large survey of 12,065 estimated effect sizes from 200 meta-analyses and nearly 8,000 papers is used to assess these key dimensions of replicability. First, our survey finds that psychological research is, on average, afflicted with low statistical power. The median of median power across these 200 areas of research is about 36\%, and only about 8\% of studies have adequate power (using Cohen's 80\% convention). Second, the median proportion of the observed variation among reported effect sizes attributed to heterogeneity is 74\% (I2). Heterogeneity of this magnitude makes it unlikely that the typical psychological study can be closely replicated when replication is defined as study-level null hypothesis significance testing. Third, the good news is that we find only a small amount of average residual reporting bias, allaying some of the often-expressed concerns about the reach of publication bias and questionable research practices. Nonetheless, the low power and high heterogeneity that our survey finds fully explain recent difficulties to replicate highly regarded psychological studies and reveal challenges for scientific progress in psychology.

One of the most prominent questionable research practices is p-hacking. Typically, p-hacking is defined as a compound of strategies targeted at rendering non-significant hypothesis testing results significant. However, a comprehensive overview of these p-hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of 12 p-hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies. We also use our simulation results to evaluate several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate the influence of questionable research practices. Our results show that investigating p-hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of p-hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of p-hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of p-hacking in practice.},

  abstract = {Publication and selection biases in meta-analysis are more likely to affect small studies, which also tend to be of lower methodological quality. This may lead to "small-study effects," where the smaller studies in a meta-analysis show larger treatment effects. Small-study effects may also arise because of between-trial heterogeneity. Statistical tests for small-study effects have been proposed, but their validity has been questioned. A set of typical meta-analyses containing 5, 10, 20, and 30 trials was defined based on the characteristics of 78 published meta-analyses identified in a hand search of eight journals from 1993 to 1997. Simulations were performed to assess the power of a weighted regression method and a rank correlation test in the presence of no bias, moderate bias or severe bias. We based evidence of small-study effects on P {$<$} 0.1. The power to detect bias increased with increasing numbers of trials. The rank correlation test was less powerful than the regression method. For example, assuming a control group event rate of 20\% and no treatment effect, moderate bias was detected with the regression test in 13.7\%, 23.5\%, 40.1\% and 51.6\% of meta-analyses with 5, 10, 20 and 30 trials. The corresponding figures for the correlation test were 8.5\%, 14.7\%, 20.4\% and 26.0\%, respectively. Severe bias was detected with the regression method in 23.5\%, 56.1\%, 88.3\% and 95.9\% of meta-analyses with 5, 10, 20 and 30 trials, as compared to 11.9\%, 31.1\%, 45.3\% and 65.4\% with the correlation test. Similar results were obtained in simulations incorporating moderate treatment effects. However the regression method gave false-positive rates which were too high in some situations (large treatment effects, or few events per trial, or all trials of similar sizes). Using the regression method, evidence of small-study effects was present in 21 (26.9\%) of the 78 published meta-analyses. Tests for small-study effects should routinely be performed in meta-analysis. Their power is however limited, particularly for moderate amounts of bias or meta-analyses based on a small number of small studies. When evidence of small-study effects is found, careful consideration should be given to possible explanations for these in the reporting of the meta-analysis.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, psychology researchers have become increasingly preoccupied with the question of whether findings from psychological studies are generally replicable. The debates have originated from some unfortunate events of scientific misconduct in the field, and they have reached a climax with the recent discovery of a relatively weak rate of replicability of published literature, leading to the so-called replicability crisis in psychology. The present paper is concerned with examining the issue of replicability in the field of social psychology. We begin by drawing a state of the art of the crisis in this field. We then highlight some possible causes for the crisis, discussing topics of statistical power, questionable research practices, publication standards, and hidden auxiliary assumptions of context-dependency of social psychological theories. Finally, we argue that given the absence of absolute falsification in science, social psychology could greatly benefit from adopting McGuire's perspectivist approach to knowledge construction.

Both faculty and student participants were asked to report their own engagement as well as the engagement of their graduate school mentor in 12 QRPs. Nearly 65\% of the faculty participants and 50\% of the student participants reported engaging in at least one QRP. The most commonly reported QRP was selectively reporting findings that worked (35\% for faculty, 26\% for students), and the least commonly admitted was falsifying data (0\% for faculty, 1\% for students). Total number of QRPs engaged in was significantly predicted by knowledge of mentor engagement in QRPs (explaining 34\% of the variance for faculty and 19\% of the variance for students), but it was not predicted by degree year, number of publications, or self-reported researcher reputation. These results suggest that QRPs do occur in the field but perhaps at lower levels than had previously been thought. They also suggest that additional training in QRPs is needed. Training implications and future directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

This study conducted a series of meta-analyses and compiled results to identify thresholds specific to S\&C, and create prior distributions for Bayesian updating. Pre- and post-training data from S\&C interventions were translated into standardised mean difference (SMDpre) and percentage improvement (\%Improve) effect sizes. Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis models were conducted to compare effect sizes, develop prior distributions, and estimate 0.25-, 0.5-, and 0.75-quantiles to determine small, medium, and large thresholds, respectively. Data from 643 studies comprising 6574 effect sizes were included in the analyses. Large differences in distributions for both SMDpre and \%Improve were identified across outcome domains (strength, power, jump and sprint performance), with analyses of the tails of the distributions indicating potential large overestimations of SMDpre values. Future evaluations of S\&C training will be improved using Bayesian approaches featuring the information and priors developed in this study. To facilitate an uptake of Bayesian methods within S\&C, an easily accessible tool employing intuitive Bayesian updating was created. It is recommended that the tool and specific thresholds be used instead of isolated effect size calculations and Cohen's generic values when evaluating S\&C training.},

  abstract = {Objective To quantify and describe effect size distributions from exercise therapies across a range of tendinopathies and outcome domains to inform future research and clinical practice through conducting a systematic review with meta-analysis. Design Systematic review with meta-analysis exploring moderating effects and context-specific small, medium and large thresholds. Eligibility criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving any persons with a diagnosis of rotator cuff, lateral elbow, patellar, Achilles or gluteal tendinopathy of any severity or duration. Methods Common databases, six trial registries and six grey literature databases were searched on 18 January 2021 (PROSPERO: CRD42020168187). Standardised mean difference (SMDpre) effect sizes were used with Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis models to calculate the 0.25 (small), 0.5 (medium) and 0.75 quantiles (large) and compare pooled means across potential moderators. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool. Results Data were obtained from 114 studies comprising 171 treatment arms 4104 participants. SMDpre effect sizes were similar across tendinopathies but varied across outcome domains. Greater threshold values were obtained for self-reported measures of pain (small=0.5, medium=0.9 and large=1.4), disability (small=0.6, medium=1.0 and large=1.5) and function (small=0.6, medium=1.1 and large=1.8) and lower threshold values obtained for quality of life (small=-0.2, medium=0.3 and large=0.7) and objective measures of physical function (small=0.2, medium=0.4 and large=0.7). Potential moderating effects of assessment duration, exercise supervision and symptom duration were also identified, with greater pooled mean effect sizes estimated for longer assessment durations, supervised therapies and studies comprising patients with shorter symptom durations. Conclusion The effect size of exercise on tendinopathy is dependent on the type of outcome measure assessed. Threshold values presented here can be used to guide interpretation and assist with further research better establishing minimal important change.},

  abstract = {We have empirically assessed the distribution of published effect sizes and estimated power by analyzing 26,841 statistical records from 3,801 cognitive neuroscience and psychology papers published recently. The reported median effect size was D = 0.93 (interquartile range: 0.64--1.46) for nominally statistically significant results and D = 0.24 (0.11--0.42) for nonsignificant results. Median power to detect small, medium, and large effects was 0.12, 0.44, and 0.73, reflecting no improvement through the past half-century. This is so because sample sizes have remained small. Assuming similar true effect sizes in both disciplines, power was lower in cognitive neuroscience than in psychology. Journal impact factors negatively correlated with power. Assuming a realistic range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, false report probability is likely to exceed 50\% for the whole literature. In light of our findings, the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic, and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience., Biomedical science, psychology, and many other fields may be suffering from a serious replication crisis. In order to gain insight into some factors behind this crisis, we have analyzed statistical information extracted from thousands of cognitive neuroscience and psychology research papers. We established that the statistical power to discover existing relationships has not improved during the past half century. A consequence of low statistical power is that research studies are likely to report many false positive findings. Using our large dataset, we estimated the probability that a statistically significant finding is false (called false report probability). With some reasonable assumptions about how often researchers come up with correct hypotheses, we conclude that more than 50\% of published findings deemed to be statistically significant are likely to be false. We also observed that cognitive neuroscience studies had higher false report probability than psychology studies, due to smaller sample sizes in cognitive neuroscience. In addition, the higher the impact factors of the journals in which the studies were published, the lower was the statistical power. In light of our findings, the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic, and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.},

We review these shortcomings and suggest that, after sustained negative experience, NHST should no longer be the default, dominant statistical practice of all biomedical and psychological research. If theoretical predictions are weak we should not rely on all or nothing hypothesis tests. Different inferential methods may be most suitable for different types of research questions. Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including negative findings. Hypothesis-testing studies should be pre-registered and optimally raw data published. The current statistics lite educational approach for students that has sustained the widespread, spurious use of NHST should be phased out.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Training in hypoxia versus normoxia often induces larger physiological adaptations, while this does not always translate into additional performance benefits. A possible explanation is a reduced oxygen flux, negatively affecting training intensity and/or volume (decreasing training stimulus). Repeated Wingates (RW) in normoxia is an efficient training strategy for improving both physiological parameters and exercise capacity. However, it remains unclear whether the addition of hypoxia has a detrimental effect on RW performance. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that acute moderate hypoxia exposure has no detrimental effect on RW, while both metabolic and perceptual responses would be slightly higher. METHODS: On separate days, 7 male university sprinters performed 3 {\texttimes} 30-s Wingate efforts with 4.5-min passive recovery in either hypoxia (FiO2: 0.145) or normoxia (FiO2: 0.209). Arterial oxygen saturation was assessed before the first Wingate effort, while blood lactate concentration and ratings of perceived exertion were measured after each bout. RESULTS: Mean (P = .92) and peak (P = .63) power outputs, total work (P = .98), and the percentage decrement score (P = .25) were similar between conditions. Arterial oxygen saturation was significantly lower in hypoxia versus normoxia (92.0\%~[2.8\%] vs 98.1\% [0.4\%], P {$<$} .01), whereas blood lactate concentration (P = .78) and ratings of perceived exertion (P = .51) did not differ between conditions. CONCLUSION: In sprinters, acute exposure to moderate hypoxia had no detrimental effect on RW performance and associated metabolic and perceptual responses.},

  abstract = {Open science practices including open access (OA) publication, open methods, study preregistration, and open data are gaining acceptance across diverse fields of research. These practices are promoted as strategies to improve the reproducibility of research findings and the replicability of studies to accumulate knowledge and advance science. However, these arguments may raise concerns for qualitative researchers, and open science practices pose several challenges for qualitative researchers. The purpose of this paper is: (1) to review the state of open science practices within sport and exercise psychology, and (2) to discuss the implications of open science for qualitative inquiry. We examined open science practices across quantitative and qualitative articles in 11 sport and exercise psychology journals. While OA publication is a relatively recent phenomenon, OA articles were cited slightly more often than non-OA articles, although this difference was not significant. Some researchers provided supplementary materials alongside published articles, but researchers do not appear to be openly sharing the methods and data from their studies. No articles were published as preregistered studies at the time of our review. Some benefits of open science practices for qualitative inquiry include transparent documentation of the research process, opportunities for collaborative and pluralistic analyses, access to data across multiple research sites and from difficult-to-access settings and participants, and opportunities for teaching qualitative inquiry. We conclude by addressing several key questions including participant consent, confidentiality and anonymity, analyzing de-contextualized qualitative data, storing and accessing data, study preregistration, and the principle of emergent design within qualitative inquiry.},

  abstract = {Data analysts frequently calculate power and sample size for a planned study using mean and variance estimates from an initial trial. Hence power, or the sample size needed to achieve a fixed power, varies randomly. Such calculations can be very inaccurate in the General Linear Univariate Model (GLUM). Biased noncentrality estimators and censored power calculations create inaccuracy. Censoring occurs if only certain outcomes of an initial trial lead to a power calculation. For example, a confirmatory study may be planned (and a sample size estimated) only following a significant result in the initial trial., Computing accurate point estimates or confidence bounds of GLUM noncentrality, power, or sample size in the presence of censoring involves truncated noncentral F distributions. We recommend confidence bounds, whether or not censoring occurs. A power analysis of data from humans exposed to carbon monoxide demonstrates the substantial impact on sample size that may occur. The results highlight potential biases and should aid study planning and interpretation.},

We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders.

Despite its critical importance, it curiously remains poorly understood in a number of dimensions. In order to address this, we have analysed peer review to assess where the major gaps in our theoretical and empirical understanding of it lie. We identify core themes including editorial responsibility, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, the function and quality of peer review, and the social and epistemic implications of peer review. The high-priority gaps are focused around increased accountability and justification in decision-making processes for editors and developing a deeper, empirical understanding of the social impact of peer review. Addressing this at the bare minimum will require the design of a consensus for a minimal set of standards for what constitutes peer review, and the development of a shared data infrastructure to support this. Such a field requires sustained funding and commitment from publishers and research funders, who both have a commitment to uphold the integrity of the published scholarly record. We use this to present a guide for the future of peer review, and the development of a new research discipline based on the study of peer review.},

  abstract = {Background Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers -- data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

  abstract = {Background Published studies in the life and health sciences often employ sample sizes that are too small to detect realistic effect sizes. This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations. Objective We aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Power's default option for mixed-design ANOVAs---which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researcher's intended purpose. Method We randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors. Results We estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65\% [95\% CI: 0.62\% - 0.67\%] of articles). We could reproduce 2\% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28\% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75\%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48\%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8\%; 3/36). Conclusion Published sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.},

They state something that the scientific process will attempt to evaluate, corroborate, verify or falsify. Their purpose is to guide the types of data we collect, analyses we conduct, and inferences we would like to make. Over the last decade, metascience has advocated for hypotheses being in preregistrations or registered reports, but how to formulate these hypotheses has received less attention. Here, we argue that hypotheses can vary in specificity along at least three independent dimensions: the relationship, the variables, and the pipeline. Together, these dimensions form the scope of the hypothesis. We demonstrate how narrowing the scope of a hypothesis in any of these three ways reduces the hypothesis space and that this reduction is a type of novelty. Finally, we discuss how this formulation of hypotheses can guide researchers to formulate the appropriate scope for their hypotheses and should aim for neither too broad nor too narrow a scope. This framework can guide hypothesis-makers when formulating their hypotheses by helping clarify what is being tested, chaining results to previous known findings, and demarcating what is explicitly tested in the hypothesis.},

This creates a conflict between what is best for scientists' careers and what is best for science. In this article, we show how the theory of multilevel selection provides conceptual tools for modifying incentives to better align individual and collective interests. A core principle is the need to account for indirect effects by shifting the level at which selection operates from individuals to the groups in which individuals are embedded. This principle is used in several fields to improve collective outcomes, including animal husbandry, team sports, and professional organizations. Shifting the level of selection has the potential to ameliorate several problems in contemporary science, including accounting for scientists' diverse contributions to knowledge generation, reducing individual-level competition, and promoting specialization and team science. We discuss the difficulties associated with shifting the level of selection and outline directions for future development in this domain.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of 12 wk of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during endurance training on omega-3 index (O3I) and indicators of running performance in amateur long-distance runners. METHODS: Twenty-six amateur male long-distance runners {$\geq$}29 yr old supplemented omega-3 fatty acid capsules (OMEGA group, n = 14; 2234 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 916 mg of docosahexaenoic acid daily) or medium-chain triglycerides capsules as placebo (medium-chain triglyceride [MCT] group, n = 12; 4000 mg of MCT daily) during 12 wk of endurance training. Before and after intervention, blood samples were collected for O3I assessment, and an incremental test to exhaustion and a 1500-m run trial were performed. RESULTS: O3I was significantly increased in the OMEGA group (from 5.8\% to 11.6\%, P {$<$} 0.0001). A significant increase in {\.V}O 2peak was observed in the OMEGA group (from 53.6 {\textpm} 4.4 to 56.0 {\textpm} 3.7 mL{$\cdot$}kg -1 {$\cdot$}min -1 , P = 0.0219) without such change in MCT group (from 54.7 {\textpm} 6.8 to 56.4 {\textpm} 5.9 mL{$\cdot$}kg -1 {$\cdot$}min -1 , P = 0.1308). A positive correlation between the change in O3I and the change in running economy was observed when data of participants from both groups were combined (-0.1808 {\textpm} 1.917, P = 0.0020), without such an effect in OMEGA group alone ( P = 0.1741). No effect of omega-3 supplementation on 1500-m run results was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation at a dose of 2234 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 916 mg of docosahexaenoic acid daily during endurance training resulted in the improvement of O3I and running economy and increased {\.V}O 2peak without improvement in the 1500-m run trial time in amateur runners.},

  abstract = {Researchers commonly make dichotomous claims based on continuous test statistics. Many have branded the practice as a misuse of statistics and criticize scientists for the widespread application of hypothesis tests to tentatively reject a hypothesis (or not) depending on whether a p-value is below or above an alpha level. Although dichotomous claims are rarely explicitly defended, we argue they play an important epistemological and pragmatic role in science. The epistemological function of dichotomous claims consists in transforming data into quasibasic statements, which are tentatively accepted singular facts that can corroborate or falsify theoretical claims. This transformation requires a prespecified methodological decision procedure such as Neyman-Pearson hypothesis tests. From the perspective of methodological falsificationism these decision procedures are necessary, as probabilistic statements (e.g., continuous test statistics) cannot function as falsifiers of substantive hypotheses. The pragmatic function of dichotomous claims is to facilitate scrutiny and criticism among peers by generating contestable claims, a process referred to by Popper as ``conjectures and refutations.'' We speculate about how the surprisingly widespread use of a 5\% alpha level might have facilitated this pragmatic function. Abandoning dichotomous claims, for example because researchers commonly misuse p-values, would sacrifice their crucial epistemic and pragmatic functions.},

In the past decade, observational studies of the scientific literature have indicated that numerous questionable research practices and poor reporting practices may be hindering scientific progress. In particular, 3 recent studies have indicated an implausibly high rate of studies with positive (i.e., hypothesis confirming) results. In sports medicine, a field closely related to kinesiology, studies that tested a hypothesis indicated support for their primary hypothesis {\textasciitilde}70\% of the time. However, a study of journals that cover the entire field of kinesiology has yet to be completed, and the quality of other reporting practices, such as clinical trial registration, has not been evaluated. In this study we retrospectively evaluated 300 original research articles from the flagship journals of North America (Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise), Europe (European Journal of Sport Science), and Australia (Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport). The hypothesis testing rate ({\textasciitilde}64\%) and positive result rate ({\textasciitilde}81\%) were much lower than what has been reported in other fields (e.g., psychology), and there was only weak evidence for our hypothesis that the positive result rate exceeded 80\%. However, the positive result rate is still considered unreasonably high. Additionally, most studies did not report trial registration, and rarely included accessible data indicating rather poor reporting practices. The majority of studies relied upon significance testing ({\textasciitilde}92\%), but it was more concerning that a majority of studies ({\textasciitilde}82\%) without a stated hypothesis still relied upon significance testing. Overall, the positive result rate in kinesiology is unacceptably high, despite being lower than other fields such as psychology, and most published manuscripts demonstrated subpar reporting practices},

This is highlighted by the current reproducibility crisis, and this crisis disproportionately affects fields that use behavioral research methods, as in much lighting research. A sample of general and topic-specific lighting research papers was reviewed for information about sample sizes and statistical reporting. This highlighted that lighting research is generally underpowered and, given median sample sizes, is unlikely to be able to reveal small effects. Lighting research most commonly uses parametric statistical tests, but assessment of test assumptions is rarely carried out. This risks the inappropriate use of statistical tests, potentially leading to type I and type II errors. Lighting research papers also rarely report measures of effect size, and this can hamper cumulative science and power analyses required to determine appropriate sample sizes for future research studies.

In this paper, we argue that prevention science will be better positioned to help improve public health if (a) more replications are conducted; (b) those replications are systematic, thoughtful, and conducted with full knowledge of the trials that have preceded them; and (c) state-of-the art techniques are used to summarize the body of evidence on the effects of the interventions. Under real-world demands it is often not feasible to wait for multiple replications to accumulate before making decisions about intervention adoption. To help individuals and agencies make better decisions about intervention utility, we outline strategies that can be used to help understand the likely direction, size, and range of intervention effects as suggested by the current knowledge base. We also suggest structural changes that could increase the amount and quality of replication research, such as the provision of incentives and a more vigorous pursuit of prospective research registers. Finally, we discuss methods for integrating replications into the roll-out of a program and suggest that strong partnerships with local decision makers are a key component of success in replication research. Our hope is that this paper can highlight the importance of replication and stimulate more discussion of the important elements of the replication process. We are confident that, armed with more and better replications and state-of-the-art review methods, prevention science will be in a better position to positively impact public health.},

The methodology on which the p-uniform and p-curve methods are based has great promise for providing accurate meta-analytic estimates in the presence of publication bias. However, in this article, we show that in some situations, p-curve behaves erratically, whereas p-uniform may yield implausible estimates of negative effect size. Moreover, we show that (and explain why) p-curve and p-uniform result in overestimation of effect size under moderate-to-large heterogeneity and may yield unpredictable bias when researchers employ p-hacking. We offer hands-on recommendations on applying and interpreting results of meta-analyses in general and p-uniform and p-curve in particular. Both methods as well as traditional methods are applied to a meta-analysis on the effect of weight on judgments of importance. We offer guidance for applying p-uniform or p-curve using R and a user-friendly web application for applying p-uniform.},

Although there is consensus that publication bias exists, how strongly it affects different scientific literatures is currently less well-known. We examined evidence of publication bias in a large-scale data set of primary studies that were included in 83 meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin (representing meta-analyses from psychology) and 499 systematic reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR; representing meta-analyses from medicine). Publication bias was assessed on all homogeneous subsets (3.8\% of all subsets of meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin) of primary studies included in meta-analyses, because publication bias methods do not have good statistical properties if the true effect size is heterogeneous. Publication bias tests did not reveal evidence for bias in the homogeneous subsets. Overestimation was minimal but statistically significant, providing evidence of publication bias that appeared to be similar in both fields. However, a Monte-Carlo simulation study revealed that the creation of homogeneous subsets resulted in challenging conditions for publication bias methods since the number of effect sizes in a subset was rather small (median number of effect sizes equaled 6). Our findings are in line with, in its most extreme case, publication bias ranging from no bias until only 5\% statistically nonsignificant effect sizes being published. These and other findings, in combination with the small percentages of statistically significant primary effect sizes (28.9\% and 18.9\% for subsets published in Psychological Bulletin and CDSR), led to the conclusion that evidence for publication bias in the studied homogeneous subsets is weak, but suggestive of mild publication bias in both psychology and medicine.},

The p-uniform method as described in van Assen, van Aert, and Wicherts (2015) {$<$}https:psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-48759-001{$>$} can be used for estimating the average effect size, testing the null hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias using only the statistically significant effect sizes of primary studies. The second method in the package is the p-uniform* method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2019) {$<$}doi:10.31222/osf.io/zqjr9{$>$}. This method is an extension of the p-uniform method that allows for estimation of the average effect size and the between-study variance in a meta-analysis, and uses both the statistically significant and nonsignificant effect sizes. The third method in the package is the hybrid method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2017) {$<$}doi:10.3758/s13428-017-0967-6{$>$}. The hybrid method is a meta-analysis method for combining an original study and replication and while taking into account statistical significance of the original study. The p-uniform and hybrid method are based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. The fourth method in the package is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2018) {$<$}doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0175302{$>$}. This method computes posterior probabilities for four true effect sizes (no, small, medium, and large) based on an original study and replication while taking into account publication bias in the original study. The method can also be used for computing the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing. The meta-plot is a visual tool for meta-analysis that provides information on the primary studies in the meta-analysis, the results of the meta-analysis, and characteristics of the research on the effect under study (van Assen et al., 2021).

  abstract = {Publication bias threatens the validity of meta-analytic results and leads to overestimation of the effect size in traditional meta-analysis. This particularly applies to meta-analyses that feature small studies, which are ubiquitous in psychology. Here we develop a new method for meta-analysis that deals with publication bias. This method, p-uniform, enables (a) testing of publication bias, (b) effect size estimation, and (c) testing of the null-hypothesis of no effect. No current method for meta-analysis possesses all 3 qualities. Application of p-uniform is straightforward because no additional data on missing studies are needed and no sophisticated assumptions or choices need to be made before applying it. Simulations show that p-uniform generally outperforms the trim-and-fill method and the test of excess significance (TES; Ioannidis \& Trikalinos, 2007b) if publication bias exists and population effect size is homogenous or heterogeneity is slight. For illustration, p-uniform and other publication bias analyses are applied to the meta-analysis of McCall and Carriger (1993) examining the association between infants' habituation to a stimulus and their later cognitive ability (IQ). We conclude that p-uniform is a valuable technique for examining publication bias and estimating population effects in fixed-effect meta-analyses, and as sensitivity analysis to draw inferences about publication bias.

At the same time, we explore the performance of the approach if the outcomes used in a study can be regarded as a random sample from a population of outcomes. We conclude that although this approach is relatively simple and does not require prior estimates of the sampling covariances between effect sizes, it gives appropriate mean effect size estimates, standard error estimates, and confidence interval coverage proportions in a variety of realistic situations.},

Given lactate may mediate these effects, we used sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) supplementation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design to investigate lactate's purported role in exercise-induced appetite suppression. Eleven males completed two identical high-intensity interval training sessions (10 {\texttimes} 1 min cycling bouts at {\textasciitilde}90\% heart rate maximum interspersed with 1-min recovery), where they ingested either NaHCO3 (BICARB) or sodium chloride (NaCl) as a placebo (PLACEBO) preexercise. Blood lactate, acylated ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY concentrations, as well as overall appetite were assessed preexercise and 0, 30, 60, and 90 min postexercise. Blood lactate was greater immediately (P {$<$} 0.001) and 30 min postexercise (P = 0.049) in the BICARB session with an increased (P = 0.009) area under the curve (AUC). The BICARB session had lower acylated ghrelin at 60 (P = 0.014) and 90 min postexercise (P = 0.016), with a decreased AUC (P = 0.039). The BICARB session had increased PYY (P = 0.034) with an increased AUC (P = 0.031). The BICARB session also tended (P = 0.060) to have increased GLP-1 at 30 (P = 0.003) and 60 min postexercise (P {$<$} 0.001), with an increased AUC (P = 0.030). The BICARB session tended (P = 0.059) to reduce overall appetite, although there was no difference in AUC (P = 0.149). These findings support a potential role for lactate in the high-intensity exercise-induced appetite-suppression., NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We used sodium bicarbonate to increase lactate accumulation or sodium chloride as a placebo. Our findings further implicate lactate as a mediator of exercise-induced appetite suppression, given exercise-induced increases in lactate during the sodium bicarbonate session altered peripheral concentrations of appetite-regulating hormones, culminating in a reduction of appetite. This supports a lactate-dependent mechanism of appetite suppression following high-intensity exercise and highlights the potential of using lactate as a means of inducing a caloric deficit.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  benefits and harms associated with acute treatments for episodic migraine in  adults. DATA SOURCES: Multiple databases from database inception to February 24,  2021. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews that  assessed effectiveness or harms of acute therapy for migraine attacks. DATA  EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted  data. Meta-analysis was performed with the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model  with Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman variance correction or by using a fixed-effect  model based on the Mantel-Haenszel method if the number of studies was small.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes included pain freedom, pain relief,  sustained pain freedom, sustained pain relief, and adverse events. The strength  of evidence (SOE) was graded with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews. FINDINGS:  Evidence on triptans and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was summarized from  15 systematic reviews. For other interventions, 115 randomized clinical trials  with 28\,803 patients were included. Compared with placebo, triptans and  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used individually were significantly  associated with reduced pain at 2 hours and 1 day (moderate to high SOE) and  increased risk of mild and transient adverse events. Compared with placebo,  calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists (low to high SOE),  lasmiditan (5-HT1F receptor agonist; high SOE), dihydroergotamine (moderate to  high SOE), ergotamine plus caffeine (moderate SOE), acetaminophen (moderate SOE),  antiemetics (low SOE), butorphanol (low SOE), and tramadol in combination with  acetaminophen (low SOE) were significantly associated with pain reduction and  increase in mild adverse events. The findings for opioids were based on low or  insufficient SOE. Several nonpharmacologic treatments were significantly  associated with improved pain, including remote electrical neuromodulation  (moderate SOE), transcranial magnetic stimulation (low SOE), external trigeminal  nerve stimulation (low SOE), and noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (moderate  SOE). No significant difference in adverse events was found between  nonpharmacologic treatments and sham. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There are  several acute treatments for migraine, with varying strength of supporting  evidence. Use of triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen,  dihydroergotamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists, lasmiditan, and  some nonpharmacologic treatments was associated with improved pain and function.  The evidence for many other interventions, including opioids, was limited.},

These practices are labeled superfluous, overcomplicated, and inappropriate, respectively, and I suggest alternatives for each of them that will be useful to applied linguists and educators who need to design, analyze, or assess intervention studies or other randomized controlled trials.

  abstract = {Innovations in open science and meta-science have focused on rigorous *theory testing*, yet methods for specifying, sharing, and iteratively improving theories remain underdeveloped. To address these limitations, we introduce *FAIR theory*: A standard for specifying theories as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable information artifacts. FAIR theories are Findable in well-established archives, Accessible in practical terms and in terms of their ability to be understood, Interoperable for specific purposes, e.g., to guide control variable selection, and Reusable so that they can be iteratively improved through collaborative efforts. This paper adapts the FAIR principles for theory, reflects on the FAIRness of contemporary theoretical practices in psychology, introduces a workflow for FAIRifying theory, and explores FAIR theories' potential impact in terms of reducing research waste, enabling meta-research on the structure and development of theories, and incorporating theory into reproducible research workflows -- from hypothesis generation to simulation studies. We make use of well-established open science infrastructure, including Git for version control, GitHub for collaboration, and Zenodo for archival and search indexing. By applying the principles and infrastructure that have already revolutionized sharing of data and publications to theory,  we establish a sustainable, transparent, and collaborative approach to theory development. FAIR theory equips scholars with a standard for systematically specifying and refining theories, bridging a critical gap in open research practices and supporting the renewed interest in theory development in psychology and beyond. FAIR theory provides a structured, cumulative framework for theory development, increasing efficiency and potentially accelerating the pace of cumulative knowledge acquisition},

  abstract = {The credibility revolution (sometimes referred to as the ``replicability crisis'') in psychology has brought about many changes in the standards by which psychological science is evaluated. These changes include (a) greater emphasis on transparency and openness, (b) a move toward preregistration of research, (c) more direct-replication studies, and (d) higher standards for the quality and quantity of evidence needed to make strong scientific claims. What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress---the most important shared goal of scientists---is likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one's subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer.},

  abstract = {When consumers of science (readers and reviewers) lack relevant details about the study design, data, and analyses, they cannot adequately evaluate the strength of a scientific study. Lack of transparency is common in science, and is encouraged by journals that place more emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of a manuscript than the robustness of its scientific claims. In doing this, journals are implicitly encouraging authors to do whatever it takes to obtain eye-catching results. To achieve this, researchers can use common research practices that beautify results at the expense of the robustness of those results (e.g., p-hacking). The problem is not engaging in these practices, but failing to disclose them. A car whose carburetor is duct-taped to the rest of the car might work perfectly fine, but the buyer has a right to know about the duct-taping. Without high levels of transparency in scientific publications, consumers of scientific manuscripts are in a similar position as buyers of used cars -- they cannot reliably tell the difference between lemons and high quality findings. This phenomenon -- quality uncertainty -- has been shown to erode trust in economic markets, such as the used car market. The same problem threatens to erode trust in science. The solution is to increase transparency and give consumers of scientific research the information they need to accurately evaluate research. Transparency would also encourage researchers to be more careful in how they conduct their studies and write up their results. To make this happen, we must tie journals' reputations to their practices regarding transparency. Reviewers hold a great deal of power to make this happen, by demanding the transparency needed to rigorously evaluate scientific manuscripts. The public expects transparency from science, and appropriately so -- we should be held to a higher standard than used car salespeople.},

How can we know whether a particular scientific field has effective self-correction mechanisms, that is, whether its findings are credible? The usual processes that supposedly provide mechanisms for scientific self-correction, such as journal-based peer review and institutional committees, have been inadequate. We describe more verifiable indicators of a field's commitment to self-correction. These fall under the broad headings of 1) transparency, which is already the subject of many reform efforts and 2) critical appraisal, which has received less attention and which we focus on here. Only by obtaining Observable Self-Correction Indicators (OSCIs) can we begin to evaluate the claim that ``science is self-correcting.'' We expect that the veracity of this claim varies across fields and subfields, and suggest that some fields, such as psychology and biomedicine, fall far short of an appropriate level of transparency and, especially, critical appraisal. Fields without robust, verifiable mechanisms for transparency and critical appraisal cannot reasonably be said to be self-correcting, and thus do not warrant the credibility often imputed to science as a whole.},

A best practice for researchers using statistics would therefore be to share data among co-authors, allowing double-checking of executed tasks just as co-pilots do in aviation. To document the extent to which this `co-piloting' currently occurs in psychology, we surveyed the authors of 697 articles published in six top psychology journals and asked them whether they had collaborated on four aspects of analyzing data and reporting results, and whether the described data had been shared between the authors. We acquired responses for 49.6\% of the articles and found that co-piloting on statistical analysis and reporting results is quite uncommon among psychologists, while data sharing among co-authors seems reasonably but not completely standard. We then used an automated procedure to study the prevalence of statistical reporting errors in the articles in our sample and examined the relationship between reporting errors and co-piloting. Overall, 63\% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with the reported test statistic and the accompanying degrees of freedom, and 20\% of the articles contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent to such a degree that it may have affected decisions about statistical significance. Overall, the probability that a given p-value was inconsistent was over 10\%. Co-piloting was not found to be associated with reporting errors.},

  abstract = {To investigate how leg preference affects net efficiency ({$\eta$}net), we examined central and peripheral hemodynamics, muscle fiber type, activation and force of preferred (PL) and nonpreferred (NPL) leg. Our hypothesis was that PL greater efficiency could be explained by adaptations and interactions between central, peripheral factors, and force. Fifteen young participants performed single-leg extension exercise at absolute (35\,W) and relative [50\% peak power-output (Wpeak)] workloads with PL and NPL. Oxygen uptake, photoplethysmography, Doppler ultrasound, near-infrared-spectroscopy deoxyhemoglobin [HHb], integrated electromyography (iEMG), maximal isometric force (MVC), rate of force development (RFD50--100), and muscle biopsies of both vastus lateralis were studied to assess central and peripheral determinants of {$\eta$}net. During exercise executed at 35\,W, {$\eta$}net was 17.5\,{\textpm}\,5.1\% and 11.9\,{\textpm}\,2.1\% (P {$<$} 0.01) in PL and NPL respectively, whereas during exercise at the 50\% of Wpeak was in PL\,=\,18.1\,{\textpm}\,5.1\% and in NPL\,=\,12.5\,{\textpm}\,1.9 (P {$<$} 0.01). The only parameter correlated with {$\eta$}net was iEMG, which showed an inverse correlation for absolute (r = -0.83 and -0.69 for PL and NPL) and relative workloads (r = -0.92 and -0.79 for PL and NPL). MVC and RFD50--100 were higher in PL than in NPL but not correlated to {$\eta$}net. This study identified a critical role of leg preference in the efficiency during single-leg extension exercise. The whole spectrum of the central and peripheral, circulatory, and muscular determinants of {$\eta$}net did not explain the difference between PL and NPL efficiency. Therefore, the lower muscle activation exhibited by the PL is likely the primary determinant of this physiological phenomenon. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This study examined the impact of leg preference on efficiency during single-leg exercise. The results revealed lower efficiency of the nonpreferred leg during exercises performed at absolute and relative workloads. Central (cardiac output) and peripheral (fiber typing) determinants of efficiency did not explain the difference between the legs. However, the lower muscle activation of the preferred leg that was inversely correlated with efficiency is likely the primary determinant of this physiological feature.},

It's also important to consider the power~of the trial to detect true intervention effects. In the context of multiple outcomes, depending on the clinical objective, the power can be defined as: `disjunctive power', the probability of detecting at least one true intervention effect across all the outcomes or `marginal power' the probability of finding a true intervention effect on a nominated outcome.},

The observed outcome from a single study will differ from the true value of the outcome measure because of sampling variability. The observed outcomes from a set of related studies measuring the same outcome will, therefore, not coincide. However, one often finds that the observed outcomes differ more from each other than would be expected based on sampling variability alone. A likely explanation for this phenomenon is that the true values of the outcome measure are heterogeneous. One way to account for the heterogeneity is to assume that the heterogeneity is entirely random. Another approach is to examine whether the heterogeneity in the outcomes can be accounted for, at least in part, by a set of study-level variables describing the methods, procedures, and samples used in the different studies. The purpose of the present paper is to discuss these different approaches with particular emphasis on the interpretation of the results and practical issues.

These methods were combined with 7 estimators for the amount of residual heterogeneity in the effect sizes. Our results show that the standard method, applied in most meta-analyses up to date, does not control the Type I error rate adequately, sometimes leading to overly conservative, but usually to inflated, Type I error rates. Of the different methods evaluated, only the Knapp and Hartung method and the permutation test provide adequate control of the Type I error rate across all conditions. Due to its computational simplicity, the Knapp and Hartung method is recommended as a suitable option for most meta-analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A major reason for this unfortunate situation is the strategy of declaring statistical significance based on a P value alone, particularly, any P value below .05. The false positive report probability (FPRP), the probability of no true association between a genetic variant and disease given a statistically significant finding, depends not only on the observed P value but also on both the prior probability that the association between the genetic variant and the disease is real and the statistical power of the test. In this commentary, we show how to assess the FPRP and how to use it to decide whether a finding is deserving of attention or ``noteworthy.'' We show how this approach can lead to improvements in the design, analysis, and interpretation of molecular epidemiology studies. Our proposal can help investigators, editors, and readers of research articles to protect themselves from overinterpreting statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true association. An FPRP-based criterion for deciding whether to call a finding noteworthy formalizes the process already used informally by investigators---that is, tempering enthusiasm for remarkable study findings with considerations of plausibility.},

In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology?s academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result?a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label ?confirmatory,? and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled ?exploratory.?

Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

Metaresearch---the practice of performing research on research---is presented as a practical vehicle for improving research quality through evaluating the research processes. This article introduces the concept of metaresearch to sport as a new sub-field of sport science. The broad types of metaresearch are introduced, with a mapping of current sports metaresearch activity across these areas. Interdisciplinary centres aimed at improving scientific quality across other fields are also introduced to sport, and specific considerations for beginning metaresearch are provided for sport. This includes, for example, not performing metaresearch poorly, beginning evaluative metaresearch early to intervene before bad practice becomes normalised, leveraging required interdisciplinary expertise depending on the metaresearch question and undertaking an ethical approach for carrying out evaluation of research quality.},

Questionable research practices have potentially undermined the evidentiary value of commonly used research paradigms in psychological science. Subsequently, the evidentiary value of these common methodologies remains uncertain. To quantify the severity of these issues in the literature, we selected the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) as a case study and submitted 170 hypothesis tests spanning over 50 years of research to a preregistered p-curve analysis. The TAP literature (N = 24,685) demonstrated significant evidentiary value but yielded a small average effect size (d = 0.29) and inadequate power (38\%). The main effects demonstrated greater evidentiary value, power, and effect sizes than interactions. Studies that tested the effects of measured traits did not differ in evidentiary value or power to those that tested the effects of experimentally manipulated states. Exploratory analyses revealed that evidentiary value, statistical power, and effect sizes have improved over time. We provide recommendations for researchers who seek to maximize the evidentiary value of their psychological measures.},

However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically. Methods and Findings We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance. Conclusions Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives To investigate how subgroup analyses of published Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are performed when subgroups are created from continuous variables. Methods We carried out a review of RCTs published in 2016--2021 that included subgroup analyses. Information was extracted on whether any of the subgroups were based on continuous variables and, if so, how they were analyzed. Results Out of 428 reviewed papers, 258 (60.4\%) reported RCTs with a subgroup analysis. Of these, 178/258 (69\%) had at least one subgroup formed from a continuous variable and 14/258 (5.4\%) were unclear. The vast majority (169/178, 94.9\%) dichotomized the continuous variable and treated the subgroup as categorical. The most common way of dichotomizing was using a pre-specified cutpoint (129/169, 76.3\%), followed by a data-driven cutpoint (26/169, 15.4\%), such as the median. Conclusion It is common for subgroup analyses to use continuous variables to define subgroups. The vast majority dichotomize the continuous variable and, consequently, may lose substantial amounts of statistical information (equivalent to reducing the sample size by at least a third). More advanced methods that can improve efficiency, through optimally choosing cutpoints or directly using the continuous information, are rarely used.},

  abstract = {Efforts to increase replication rates in psychology generally consist of recommended improvements to methodology, such as increasing sample sizes to increase power or using a lower alpha level. However, little attention has been paid to how the prior odds (R) that a tested effect is true can affect the probability that a significant result will be replicable. The lower R is, the less likely a published result will be replicable even if power is high. It follows that if R is lower in one set of studies than in another, then all else being equal, published results will be less replicable in the set with lower R. We illustrate this point by presenting an analysis of data from the social-psychology and cognitive-psychology studies that were included in the Open Science Collaboration?s (2015) replication project. We found that R was lower for the social-psychology studies than for the cognitive-psychology studies, which might explain why the rate of successful replications differed between these two sets of studies. This difference in replication rates may reflect the degree to which scientists in the two fields value risky but potentially groundbreaking (i.e., low-R) research. Critically, high-R research is not inherently better or worse than low-R research for advancing knowledge. However, if they wish to achieve replication rates comparable to those of high-R fields (a judgment call), researchers in low-R fields would need to use an especially low alpha level, conduct experiments that have especially high power, or both.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced chronic kidney disease is common in older people and is frequently accompanied by metabolic acidosis. Oral sodium bicarbonate is used to  treat this acidosis, but evidence is lacking on whether or not this provides a  net gain in health or quality of life for older people. OBJECTIVES: The  objectives were to determine whether or not oral bicarbonate therapy improves  physical function, quality of life, markers of renal function, bone turnover and  vascular health compared with placebo in older people with chronic kidney disease  and mild acidosis; to assess the safety of oral bicarbonate; and to establish  whether or not oral bicarbonate therapy is cost-effective in this setting.  DESIGN: A parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial.  SETTING: The setting was nephrology and geriatric medicine outpatient departments  in 27 UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were adults aged {$\geq$}\,60 years with  advanced chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate category 4 or 5, not  on dialysis) with a serum bicarbonate concentration of {$<$}\,22\,mmol/l.  INTERVENTIONS: Eligible participants were randomised 1\,:\,1 to oral sodium  bicarbonate or matching placebo. Dosing started at 500\,mg three times daily,  increasing to 1\,g three times daily if the serum bicarbonate concentration was  {$<$}\,22\,mmol/l at 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the  between-group difference in the Short Physical Performance Battery score at 12  months, adjusted for baseline. Other outcome measures included generic and  disease-specific health-related quality of life, anthropometry, 6-minute walk  speed, grip strength, renal function, markers of bone turnover, blood pressure  and brain natriuretic peptide. All adverse events were recorded, including  commencement of renal replacement therapy. For the health economic analysis, the  incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was the main outcome. RESULTS: In  total, 300 participants were randomised, 152 to bicarbonate and 148 to placebo.  The mean age of participants was 74 years and 86 (29\%) were female. Adherence to  study medication was 73\% in both groups. A total of 220 (73\%) participants were  assessed at the 12-month visit. No significant treatment effect was evident for  the primary outcome of the between-group difference in the Short Physical  Performance Battery score at 12 months (-0.4 points, 95\% confidence interval -0.9  to 0.1 points; p\,=\,0.15). No significant treatment benefit was seen for any of  the secondary outcomes. Adverse events were more frequent in the bicarbonate arm  (457 vs. 400). Time to commencement of renal replacement therapy was similar in  both groups (hazard ratio 1.22, 95\% confidence interval 0.74 to 2.02; p\,=\,0.43).  Health economic analysis showed higher costs and lower quality of life in the  bicarbonate arm at 1 year, with additional costs of {\pounds}564 (95\% confidence interval  {\pounds}88 to {\pounds}1154) and a quality-adjusted life-year difference of -0.05 (95\%  confidence interval -0.08 to -0.01); placebo dominated bicarbonate under all  sensitivity analyses for incremental cost-effectiveness. LIMITATIONS: The trial  population was predominantly white and male, limiting generalisability. The  increment in serum bicarbonate concentrations achieved was small and a benefit  from larger doses of bicarbonate cannot be excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Oral sodium  bicarbonate did not improve a range of health measures in people aged {$\geq$}\,60 years  with chronic kidney disease category 4 or 5 and mild acidosis, and is unlikely to  be cost-effective for use in the NHS in this patient group. Once other current  trials of bicarbonate therapy in chronic kidney disease are complete, an  individual participant meta-analysis would be helpful to determine which  subgroups, if any, are more likely to benefit and which treatment regimens are  more beneficial.

  abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned - that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology - the linear mixed model - I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the "random effect" formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

Researchers estimate a large number of models in the course of their research but only publish a small number of preferred results. Authors have much influence on the results of an empirical study through their choices about model specification. I advance methods to quantify the influence of the author---or at least demonstrate the scope an author has to choose a preferred result. Multimodel analysis, combined with modern computational power, allows authors to present their preferred estimate alongside a distribution of estimates from many other plausible models. I demonstrate the method using new software and applied empirical examples. When evaluating research results, accounting for model uncertainty and model robustness is at least as important as statistical significance.}

  abstract = {Retrospective or post hoc power analysis is recommended by reviewers and editors of many journals. Little literature has been found that gave a serious study of the post hoc power. When the sample size is large, the observed effect size is a good estimator of the true effect size. One would hope that the post hoc power is also a good estimator of the true power. This article studies whether such a power estimator provides valuable information about the true power. Using analytical, numerical, and Monte Carlo approaches, our results show that the estimated power does not provide useful information when the true power is small. It is almost always a biased estimator of the true power. The bias can be negative or positive. Large sample size alone does not guarantee the post hoc power to be a good estimator of the true power. Actually, when the population variance is known, the cumulative distribution function of the post hoc power is solely a function of the population power. This distribution is uniform when the true power equals 0.5 and highly skewed when the true power is near 0 or 1. When the population variance is unknown, the post hoc power behaves essentially the same as when the variance is known.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore journal quality as perceived by clinicians and researchers in clinical neurology. METHODS: A survey was conducted from August 2003 to January 2004. Ratings for 41 selected clinical neurology journals were obtained from 254 members of the World Federation of Neurology (1,500 solicited; response rate 17\%). Participants provided demographic information and rated each journal on a 5-point Likert scale. Average ratings for all journals were compared with the ISI's journal impact factors. Ratings for each journal were also compared across geographic regions and respondent publication productivity. RESULTS: The top 5 journals were rated much more highly than the others, with mean ratings greater than 4. Mean journal ratings were highly correlated with journal impact factors (r = 0.67). Most of the top 10 journal ratings were consistent across the subgroups of geographic regions and journal paper productivity. However, significant differences among the different geographical regions and respondent productivity groups were also found for a few journals. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide valuable insight on how neurological experts perceive journals in clinical neurology. These results will likely aid researchers and clinicians in identifying potentially desirable research outlets and indicate journal status for editors. Likewise, biomedical librarians may use these results for serials collection development.},
